<h2><a name="FOREWORD" id="FOREWORD">FOREWORD</a></h2>

<p>The intent of this little volume is not to
glorify a man, but to present the parish of
the pines. Imagination has little part in its
pages, for the incidents are actual happenings
and the descriptions are taken from
life. The condition of the foresters is
really the theme, although the title draws
attention to the missionary. Because the
Rev. Frank E. Higgins has given himself
devotedly to the men of forest and river, I
have chosen his experiences as hooks on
which to hang the pictures of pinery life.
Mr. Higgins has labored with no thought of
fame, but with devotion to God and man;
and so I write not to exalt the missionary,
but to introduce you to his interesting parishioners.</p>

<p>I have written with love because I know
the Sky Pilot. I have written with prayerful
longing because I know the lumberjacks.
If through my unskilled effort you become
interested in the isolated, wayward woodsmen,
I shall be fully repaid.</p>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>

<p class="up1 center smaller">BY THE</p>

<p class="center larger">REV. JOHN E. BUSHNELL, D. D.</p>

<p class="p2">It has long been felt by those familiar
with the human side of the forest life that
its call should be heard, and that the efforts
of devoted hearts to minister to the peculiar
needs of the men behind the axe and the
saw should be made known. This volume
is a timely response to that desire. Through
a veritable forest of material the author
safely arrives with us at the camp-fire and
heart-fire of the lumberjack. Most writers
must create their own heroes; ours found
his awaiting him, for God created Frank E.
Higgins, the hero of this book. It is just
like God to make such a man when there is
such a work to be done. It shows us how
busy Providence is in human affairs. The
least we can do in return is to know that
man and get his message.</p>

<p>The dumb creatures of the wood have
just now almost a superfluity of exponents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
and disciples. The humanity of the woods
is just beginning to have its champions.</p>

<p>The Lure of the Wild has long prevailed
to call men forth to kill, or prospect, or sin,
but in a lovelier guise it will possess the
readers of this book to make them enter the
Wild to pity, love, and save. To most of
them this narrative will come as a surprise.
It may even raise the question of possible
exaggeration as to the extent of human
suffering and degradation involved in the
simple task of felling the forests to meet the
needs of a growing nation. To those,
however, who have been over the trail, it
will appeal as a moderate but faithful picture
of scenes of intensest pathos and tragedy
which are but commonplace in the parish of
the Sky Pilot to the Lumberjacks.</p>

<p>The fierceness with which evil hunts its
human prey, and makes strong men of our
own day and nation no better than the old
galley-slave, toiling to enrich their brutal
masters, can be only partially set forth in
the limits of these pages. We shall all be
made better neighbors to our homeless
brothers in the wilderness by following Mr.
Whittles' surprising and fascinating story<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
and by walking in the footsteps of the
modest missionary of the Cross, of whom he
writes, on his round of mercy through camp
and brush, for whose zeal the winter's blast
is never too severe, and whose love for souls
melts a pathway through drifted snow. We
shall be reminded afresh of how rough is
the work and how great the human sacrifice
by which the wants of civilization are
satisfied. We shall also be moved to resolve
that the amount of the vicarious suffering
of men for this end shall be reduced of all
that portion of it that comes through our
indifference and the activity of evil. This
narrative adds a unique and valuable chapter
to the records of our country. It will be
read with gratitude by every one, who for
whatever cause seeks wider knowledge of his
fellowmen. Most of all will it appeal to
the Christian hearts of our land to whom
these men of the woods will seem as brothers,
having more than their share of life's
hardships and temptations and less than
their share of its privilege and its opportunity.</p>

<p>It is most earnestly to be hoped that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
may reach all the homes of our land and
cause them to rest a while from the fiction
of the hour, that, in the glow of these
human realities, stranger than the inventions
of fancy, we may learn henceforth to suffer
in the afflictions of our exceptional members
and relieve the conditions which make them
helpless without our aid.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE LUMBERJACKS AND THE LUMBERJACK
SKY PILOT.</span></h2>

<p>While I waited for a train, a woodsman
entered the station. He was dressed in a
rough Mackinaw jacket; coarse socks held
his trousers close to his legs, and on his
hands were heavy woolen mittens. Everything
proclaimed him to be a man of the
camps.</p>

<p>"Hello, Jack," I said in greeting, "how
were the woods this winter? Anything new
in the camps?"</p>

<p>Jack jammed the Peerless into his strong-smelling
pipe, struck a match and replied:
"Snowed so blank hard that half the gang
jumped the job, and us fools that stayed
worked up to our necks trying to get out the
stuff. This winter was Hades, but not quite
so warm&mdash;no, not by a jugfull. Why say,
neighbor, in our camp the whisky froze up
and kept the bunch sober until we got a new
supply."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
He paused, looked me over, and began
again:</p>

<p>"You're a preacher, ain't you?"</p>

<p>"I am," I replied.</p>

<p>"Well, then, here's news you'll enjoy.
We're all thinking of joining the church&mdash;us
fellows in the camps. Funny, ain't it?
The gospel sharks are in the tall timber and
are getting bags of game that would shame
a pot hunter. The cloth has donned overalls
and is preaching at us. Savvy, Preacher?&mdash;we've
actually got so civilized that they're
preaching at us God-forsaken lumberjacks.
How does that strike you for news?"</p>

<p>He paused to see the effect this intelligence
was having on me, then continued:</p>

<p>"The sermons we get are the real thing.
No sun-proof paint on them, no 'by-your-leave,'
but the straight goods, the pure stuff&mdash;chips,
bark and timber. Everything we
get is government sealed, punk proof, top-loaded
and headed for the landing&mdash;which
is us. It all comes our way and we hold our
noses and take the medicine. What party
do you happen to hitch to?"</p>

<p>"Denomination?" I asked, "I am a Presbyterian."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
"Good! So am I. I don't happen to belong
yet, but if they keep on hewing to the
line, I'll have to join&mdash;or hike. Our Sky
Pilot, Frank Higgins, belongs to your
crowd. Probably you know him?"</p>

<p>"I have known him a long time," I replied.</p>

<p>"Shake! If you're a friend of his you'll
do. He's onto his job, and if this keeps up,
the guy that splashes ink on the church roll
will be kept busy adding our names. There's
my train."</p>

<p>He was gone. May the day soon come
when the half jesting prophecy of the lumberjack
will be fulfilled.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Stately and green is the forest of the
North Star State. From Lake Superior the
great pineries of Minnesota extend unbroken
until the fertile silt of the Red River
Valley limits the growth of the pines. Two
hundred miles is the width of the forest and
the evergreen covers the northern half of
the state. This is "the woods" of Minnesota&mdash;the
center of the logging industry.</p>

<p>About five hundred camps mar this beautiful
region with their rude shacks and temporary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
shelters, some of them being scores
of miles from the permanent settlements.
During the winter months twenty thousand
men labor in the scattered camps of this vast
territory, removing the growth of ages that
the farms and cities may have comfort and
protection. The primeval forest has been
invaded, and on the zero air of the north
the ring of the ax, the tearing of saws and
the strange oaths of the teamsters mingle
with the crash of falling trees.</p>

<p>The workers of the forest are called lumberjacks.
In all the country there is
scarcely a more interesting group of men&mdash;interesting
because so wayward and prodigal
in life and habit, while their forest home appeals
to every leaf-loving soul. They are the
nomads of the west&mdash;farm hands and railroad
constructionists in summer, woodsmen
in winter&mdash;with no settled abode, no place
they call home. A few years ago Michigan
claimed them; later their habitat was in the
forests of Wisconsin; now the woods of Minnesota
is their rendezvous.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img id="if_illo_019" src="images/illo_019.jpg" width="600" height="347" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption">LUMBER CAMP IN THE LONG, LACE-LIKE NORWAYS</div></div>

<p>The typical lumberjack is a man of large
heart and little will. He sins with willing
freedom, because he has almost lost the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
power to check his evil desires, and it is so
easy to yield to the vultures who make sin
convenient and righteousness hard. The
saloon and brothel are ever alluringly near,
while the church and bethel are slow to approach.
The harpies of sin wait at every
turn to prey upon the woodsman&mdash;though
they damn his soul it matters not, if they
obtain the cash.</p>

<p>The railroads push their iron arms into
the heart of the wooded lands, and the villages
follow the railways, desiring to be near
the camps for the trade they bring. Almost
without exception the first places of business
are the saloons, to which are attached the
outfits of the gamblers, and conveniently
near are the places of shame. One new town
in the pineries had between forty and fifty
saloons (forty-six I believe is the number),
five large brothels, and the gambling hells
were many, yet the population of the place
was little over two thousand. It was evident
to the casual visitor that its chief industry
was to separate the campmen from their
earnings by preying on their weaknesses.
Another village is beautifully situated at the
junction of two rivers. All around it is well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
timbered land, and from the nature of the
soil the place is destined to be of importance
in the coming years, but at the time of this
writing the village with its adjacent territory
only contains a population of about two
hundred. The village has less than a dozen
houses, but six saloons do a thriving business
and the brothel has appeared. You ask
where the places obtain their patronage?
From the camps. The foresters are the
source of profit; the population of the town
would not be able to keep one saloon in business.
Nor are these solitary instances. The
same conditions are to be found in almost
every hamlet and village in the woods. Day
and night they ply their sinful trade, and
soon the gold, which the lumberjack risked
his life to win, jingles in the coffers of the
shameless or gleams in the till of the saloon
or gambling hell.</p>

<p>Sunday is the harvest day of iniquity.
The men are released from labor and pour
into the villages to spend the hours of rest.
The wheel, whisky and women separate
them from their earnings, and like the withered
leaves of autumn the strong wielders of
the ax and canthook fall easy victims. One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
night "to blow in the stake," regrets for a
moment&mdash;then back to the loneliness of the
winter woods again. He is said to be a poor
lumberjack who can keep his wages over
night.</p>

<p>Jack is not always a willing victim. Often
by knockout drops he is reduced to insensibility
and robbed. He may complain of the
treatment, but he is helpless through lack of
evidence, and is told to "go up river," or is
hustled unfeelingly out of town. "He's only
a lumberjack and is better off when all in."
This is all the sympathy the Ishmaelite receives.
No place is open to him except the
one he should avoid. The churches are too
weak to meet the large demands, and so no
place of refuge opens its doors of hope to the
prodigal. The balm of sympathy comes to
him limitedly; humanity is as cold as the
frozen streams of his winter's retreat. Civilization
is viewed only as a place of unbridled
license where the law favors the spoiler. God
is dead. Christ is only a word of convenient
profanity. The church has forgotten the
prodigal while caring for the souls of the
saved. Thus he views life. In his wretchedness
he labors for the keepers of the gates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
of death and is satisfied, if, by the sweat of
his brow, he can win an hour of forgetfulness
in the place of riot and shame.</p>

<p>No picture was ever painted so dark as to
exclude all light. God made it so. Even in
the neglected sons of the lumber-camps is
seen a hopeful ray&mdash;for their hearts are as
rich in charity as their lives are dark with
sin. Their sympathies can easily be touched.
It is through the open freedom of their generous
nature that the reforming power of the
gospel can enter. The only remedy for the
campmen is the sustaining power of the Man
of Nazareth. When they shall learn to know
the Christ of God as the Savior of men, the
darkened lives of the foresters will be transformed,
and the fruits they shall bring forth
will be the wished for deeds of righteousness.</p>

<p>When the Rev. Francis Edmund Higgins,
the Lumberjack Sky Pilot, began his work
among these neglected Ishmaelites, no religious
society was making an effort to raise
the moral and spiritual condition of the
campmen. The Catholic church, then as now,
devoted itself to the hospital work in the
nearby towns, but no denomination invaded
the camps to lead the bunkmen to right living.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
At the time of this writing the Presbyterian
church is the only religious organization
having special missionaries in the lumbercamps.</p>

<p>Regardless of denominational prejudice,
the work of Frank Higgins appeals to the
whole Christian church, not only on account
of its peculiar type, but also because of the
interesting man conducting it. Fitted by nature
and training for his work, he is striving
with heart and hand in a large and lonely
field. He is the pastor of a large and scattered
flock which for long and weary years
has known no shepherd. Depraved men are
being reached, lifted and kept for God
through him&mdash;men alone are his parishioners.</p>

<p>Seldom is a pastor more beloved by his people.
The rough but kindly hearts of the lumberjacks
go out to this fearless minister who
self-sacrificingly breaks the bread of life to
the husk-fed prodigals of the far north country.
The lumberjacks will fight for their Sky
Pilot; and even the ranks of the enemy&mdash;the
saloonmen, the gamblers, the brothel keepers&mdash;are
compelled to admire this earnest Christian
minister who is valiantly fighting a hard
battle for God and righteousness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
The Rev. Frank Higgins is a resolute character,
full of zeal and undaunted courage.
God gave him a strong body and he is using
it for the Giver. That rare virtue we call tact,
or sanctified common sense, shows itself in all
his dealings with men. False dignity is absent
from him, but the dignity of sterling
purpose and determined endeavor is ever
present. He is no slave to custom, but is a
man who does things in his own way, and
does them well. The title the loggers have
conferred upon him is one of affection; he is
the Lumberjack Sky Pilot, and if you heard
his forest parishioners speak that name, you
would realize that his ordination was threefold&mdash;ordained
of God, by the presbytery and
by the lumberjacks.</p>

<p>Frank E. Higgins was born in the Queen
City of the West, Toronto, Ontario, on the
nineteenth day of August, 1865. He was the
seventh child to come into the home, but the
only one to survive the vicissitudes of infancy.
His parents were both Irish, but his
father, Samuel Higgins, was born in the Dominion,
and for some years prior to his death
kept a hotel in Toronto on the site where the
Walker House now stands. In this house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
Frank was born. Ann Higgins, the mother,
first saw the sun in the Ulster settlement of
Ireland, her parents bringing her to Canada
when she was four years old. Samuel Higgins
died when Frank was seven years of age.</p>

<p>Two years after the death of Frank's father,
Ann Higgins married John Castle, an
Englishman, who shortly afterwards moved
the family to Shelburne, Dufferin County,
Ontario. Here in the untouched wilderness
the settlers began to force an opening for
cabin and crops. The country was new. Few
white families were near, but on the Higgins
homestead were several camps of Sioux Indians.
The land was forest covered, the towering
cedar and hemlock stretched their
graceful fingers heavenward, the spreading
maples delighted the eye, and the white robes
of the slender birch lent variety to the sylvan
scene. With painful effort the sentinels
were felled and squared for cabin and sheds,
and fields of grain succeeded the fallen
forest.</p>

<p>The companions of Frank Higgins were
the children of the Sioux Indians, whose tepees
were near the homestead. With the
children of the Indians he took his lessons in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
woodcraft, learned to draw the bow, or childishly
labored at the tasks of the growing
braves. One of his early recollections is of
secretly carrying a loaf of bread from his
home to trade with an Indian youth for bow
and arrows. Perhaps the subsequent strapping
he received had something to do with
the permanency and vividness of the recollection.
For three years the Indians were his
constant playmates. From the warlike Sioux,
fearlessness was imbibed, their love of the forest
became his, and an ineffaceable delight in
tree and stream was stamped in the character
of the growing boy. "I feel it now," he said
to me, but recently when we were in the city
together, "I want to get back to the solitudes
where the trees have voices and every stream
a story. I love the camps rather than the
cities. I have never passed from my boyhood
love&mdash;my first love&mdash;the trees, the hills,
the brooks. In the pineries I feel as if I were
a boy back in the old days again."</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img id="if_illo_029" src="images/illo_029.jpg" width="600" height="417" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption">STEAM-JAMMER AT WORK</div></div>

<p>These were days of gold and purple when
the child was learning the mysteries of life,
days of ceaseless roaming in which nature
taught her truths through leaf and twig,
through dew and whispering breeze. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
nature taught&mdash;all that touches "the wild and
pillared shades" belongs to his free, frank
nature. Unknowingly he was beholding the
beauty of his future kingdom and unconsciously
equipping himself for the years of
zealous toil among the white nomads whose
weapons are the ax, the saw and the peavey&mdash;a
change in equipment and complexion,
with the same stage setting.</p>

<p>Few school privileges came to the forest
lad. When he should have been at his studies
there was no school to attend; when the
school came, only brief periods were allowed
to him. At twelve he took his place by his
stepfather's side and assisted in supporting
the family. Every hand was needed, and the
boy's little counted for much. There was
ground to clear of trees and underbrush,
there were rails to split and fields to fence,
and in the winter logging, claimed his labor
for the cash it gave in return.</p>

<p>Dufferin County could offer few advantages
in those days. Its sparsely settled condition
meant absence of amusements and
communal privileges. Most of the new settlers
were of English blood, and while they
were willing to stint and sacrifice, yet they
demanded the presence of the church. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
church was organized near the Castle home,
to which John and Ann Castle gave their
united support. Frank's stepfather was a
godly man, in whose life was reflected the
spirit of our Master's teaching. Service and
fellowship were the watchwords of the home.
Of material wealth the cabin could not boast,
but in spiritual gifts its occupants were far
from poor. It was largely through these examples
of Christian living that Frank Higgins
acquired a knowledge and interest in the
things of God.</p>

<p>When Frank was eighteen years old a wave
of religious awakening swept through the
community, and the stepson of John Castle
was one of the first to surrender to the Master.
Immediately he interested himself in
the welfare of his companions, doing personal
work among them. The result was that
most of his companions joined the company
of believers. These young men then organized
a semi-weekly prayer meeting in the
schoolhouse and Frank Higgins led the first
meeting. Nine of those who attended those
prayer meetings have since gone forth to
preach the everlasting Gospel. There must
have been good stuff among the settlers of
Dufferin County.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
The ministry always had its charms for
Frank Higgins. Long before he united with
the church, the desire to preach had possessed
him. Many were the sermons he delivered
to the cattle, stumps and trees, while going
the rounds of his daily labor. On one occasion
the stepfather and hired man hid behind
the stumps that they might receive edification
from the discourses that so often
wasted their sweetness on the desert air. Unaware
of their presence, Frank worked a
while, then, laying aside his ax, mounted a
log and began his sermon to the stumps. Vigorously
he chided them for their inactivity.
Emphatic were the woes he pronounced upon
them who were at ease, while the harvest
called loudly for workers. Enthusiastically
he bade the stumps march forward and with
unsheathed sword take possession of the
Promised Land. The hidden ones, suppressing
mirth that almost injured them, silently
thrust their heads above the hiding place
and looked with forced solemnity at the big,
lonely preacher. So unexpected was their appearance,
that he, who a moment before was
willing to lead an army of stumps to victory,
retreated to the cover of the forest, pursued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
by the convulsing laughter of his friends.
Years afterwards, when commenting on the
above incident, he said: "You see, it was a
sermon to men after all. I had intended it
for stumps, but it produced action among
men." He laughed.</p>

<p>Men have always been his auditors. From
the time of his stump sermon they have listened
to his story of the Cross, and today
among the stumps of the pineries he preaches
with results that cause the angels to laugh in
gladness.</p>

<p>At the age of twenty Frank Higgins returned
to Toronto, the city of his birth,
where he resided with relatives. He there
entered the public schools, taking up the
studies which the conditions in Dufferin
County prevented him from acquiring in
boyhood. It took courage to enter the sixth
grade of the city schools, a big brawny man
among babes. Unaccustomed to cities and
civilization, he felt ill at ease away from his
native woods. His hands were better acquainted
with the ax than with the pen and
pencil, but he stuck to his task while the
blush of shame mounted his cheek as he sat
among the little children of the grade. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
teachers did not find him an apt scholar, but
they bowed before the originality of his untutored
mind.</p>

<p>Three years were spent in the grades and
two in the high school, after which he left
the Dominion of Canada and came to Minnesota,
at the age of twenty-five.</p>

<p>In the fall of 1890 he began lay preaching
in the Methodist Episcopal church at Annandale,
Minnesota, and for two years labored
in that field; doing very successful
work. He was fortunate in the companionship
of Dr. A.&nbsp;M. Ridgeway, a young physician
who had recently begun to practice in
the village. This friend did all he could to
cover the defects of the frontiersman and to
aid him to self-improvement. It was largely
through Dr. Ridgeway's persuasion that Higgins
gave up his work at Annandale and
went to Hamline University to continue his
studies. For two years he applied himself to
books, but owing to the scarcity of funds he
was compelled to preach on the Sabbaths,
and the small salary thus obtained helped
to support him in the University. The name
of the late Rev. L.&nbsp;M. Merritt, of Onesta M.
E. Church, Duluth, Minnesota, is held by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
him in revered memory for the timely encouragement
and assistance rendered him at
this period.</p>

<p>In 1895 the way opened for him to enter
the service of his mother church. The Presbyterian
Church at Barnum, Minnesota, was
offered to him and the layman found himself
in the denomination of his youth. The
work at Barnum, Minnesota, changed the
whole course of his life.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE WORK AT BARNUM, MINNESOTA.</span></h2>

<p>The new field to which Mr. Higgins went
was a lumber town. Barnum, Minnesota,
had a population of less than four hundred,
but the nearby lumber camps added considerably
to its business interests. The Presbyterian
Church at that place was weak, and
when Presbytery sent the young Canadian
there to advance the cause of Christ, it also
took him under its care as a student for the
ministry, and assigned studies suited to his
special case.</p>

<p>At Barnum, Frank Higgins first came
into touch with the loggers of Minnesota.
On all sides were the camps crowded with
men who felled the forests during the winter,
and in the spring floated the logs over lake
and river to the large sawmills farther south.</p>

<p>Shortly after he changed his residence to
the lumber town, he went with several
friends across the country to where the river<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
drivers were at work on the Kettle River
drive. It was spring. The ice-locked lakes
and rivers were once more open, and now
the accumulated logs that had been placed
on the icy lakes and streams were floating
with the current to the city mills.</p>

<p>After several hours traveling through a
rough and new country, parts of which were
cut over lands, scenically uninviting, the
party arrived at the point of the river where
the men, who, in the parlance of the loggers
are called "riverpigs," were at work. In
midstream the men were sacking logs with
peavey, or directing with pike pole. From
log to log the skillful drivers leaped, now riding
on the huge timbers, now wading in the
shallows, or following the logs from the
shore. It seemed an easy thing to do, to ride
the swift moving logs, but only a master
can keep his place on the unsteady, rolling
steed.</p>

<p>In a bend of the river, below the place
where the drivers were working, the large
flat-boat called the wannigan, was tied.
The wannigan is a floating bunkhouse, cookshed
and store combined. In it the men
make their home during the drive. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
supper hour was near when the visitors arrived
at Kettle River; the journey had been
long, so the disturbing blast of the cookee's
horn was a welcome sound. In response to
the call the rivermen hastily made for
shore, and headed for the grassy place near
the wannigan. The example of the workers
was followed by the visitors, who helped
themselves to iron knives and forks, tin
spoons, cups and dishes. The wet drivers sat
around the campfire and ate with a heartiness
that comes from a life spent in "God's
own open air."</p>

<p>The men lounged about the fire after the
meal, and the topics of the village and the
happenings of the river were discussed. Just
as the sun was tossing back his lingering
kisses at the sleepy forest and ever wakeful
river, the riverpigs requested Mr. Higgins to
give them a gospel service. It was a surprising
request, coming from such a source,
for the river drivers looked and acted as if
they cared not for these things. The preacher
had heard their fluent profanity as they directed
the logs, and when they asked for the
gospel he could not veil his surprise. But
the request was in harmony with the hour.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
Nature was worshiping. The solemn hush
of the evening was upon tree and stream and
even the ceaseless babble of the river came
only in whispers. Man felt a desire to join
in the Creator's praise, and where is there a
better sanctuary than in the cloistered halls
of the greenwood, on the banks of a crystal
stream?</p>

<p>Taking a log for a platform, unaided by
Bible or hymn book, Mr. Higgins began the
service. "Nearer My God to Thee" was the
hymn, and the men of the pickpole joined
heartily in the song, "Jesus Lover of My
Soul;" they sang until it seemed that the
sunset joined in the praise and the trees of
the field clapped their hands in timely
melody. Over the running river the tall
pines caught up the music and bowed in reverence,
while the echoes answered back, "Oh,
Receive My Soul at Last."</p>

<p>With what supreme interest the men about
the camp-fire listened to the old, old story of
Christ who loves the wanderer! The shades
of night fell low upon the darkening earth
while the preacher spoke of The Light of
The World, and the men sat wrapped in
thoughts of things they had forgotten or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
never known. Recollections of the home tree
came back to some, and the sweet lullaby of
a mother stole into minds long forgetful of
home and other days. At the spring of boyhood
they drank again, and the counsels of
youth came with hallowed sweetness to the
men seated in the playing shadows of the dying
fire.</p>

<p>Faces long strange to tears were furrowed.
Wishes were born that later became realities
of good. Like a voice from another world
came the benediction to the group about the
bright glowing embers. From across the
stream the echo floated back, and the
"amen" of nature came like a mother's
tender prayer.</p>

<p>On the morrow when the visitors were returning,
several of the rivermen went to the
preacher and spoke of the pleasure they had
derived from the service.</p>

<p>"We're away out here in the timber and it
ain't often the church comes our way," said
one.</p>

<p>"If some preacher would come here once
in a while, he could give us a lift. The Lord
knows we need it," added another.</p>

<p>"Can't you come and give us a turn?"
they asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
In response to the extended invitations,
Mr. Higgins often went to the drive on Kettle
River. An appreciative audience was always
waiting&mdash;an audience that would gladden
the heart of any minister who was anxious
to deliver God's message.</p>

<p>Prior to his visit to Kettle River, Mr. Higgins
had never been on the drive. Everything
about the work was new to him, but he
joined the riverpigs on the stream, and
added to their merriment by his unskilled
attempts at logdriving. Taking the long
pickpole, the preacher mounted the floating
log, while every driver looked out of the tail
of his eye for the soon-coming moment when
"his reverence" would descend to the depths&mdash;"so
far," said one of the men, "that he
would draw down the log with a suction."
In the midst of their work the drivers
shouted advice and encouragement.</p>

<p>But a laugh does not deter a man like
Frank Higgins. The love of the forest and
river was in his blood, and the strong body
and determined will welcomed the difficulties
of the river. Even the discomforts of a sudden
bath did not cool his zeal. He believed
that if these men were to be his hearers he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
must know how to appreciate their labors,
and that appreciation could only be acquired
by passing through the intricacies of the
calling. So skill came with practice, and a
knowledge of the drive after many sudden
descents into the flowing waters.</p>

<p>This was a part of the equipment for ministering&mdash;a
strange preparation&mdash;but men
whose labors demand strength of limb and
skill of body are more likely to listen to him
who can prove his physical ability. In the
estimation of some, manual labor may not
preserve the dignity of the cloth, but it adds
to the dignity of the man. The lumberjacks
and rivermen have no admiration for him
who is fearful of hardship, or succumbs before
the strenuous labor which they themselves
must daily perform. The pineries is
no place for weaklings, nor the drive for the
fearful. Among these men physical prowess
wins where mental powers fail to get a hearing,
but the combination of both, backed by
a strong desire to serve, is a combination
sure of success.</p>

<p>"When you are in Barnum I want you
men to remember me," said the preacher to
the drivers. "My home and church are open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
to you. You are just as welcome as the people
of the village."</p>

<p>Shortly after the above invitation the boys
came to town. It was Sunday, and the hour
of the morning service. Three big rivermen
entered the church and took seats in the rear
of the building. They were dressed as the
necessities of their vocation require, flannel
shirts resplendent in fighting colors, broad
belts, and heavy spike-soled boots. It was no
small sensation their presence created. Barnum
was a lumber town, but although accustomed
to the lumberjacks and drivers, it
had never seen them in church. The saloons
were their known retreats.</p>

<p>Before beginning the service Mr. Higgins
went down to the drivers and bade them
welcome.</p>

<p>"We thought we'd drop in and see if you'd
make us as welcome in the gospel shop as we
made you in the bunkhouse," said the
spokesman. "I guess he has, Bill," he said,
turning to his friend.</p>

<p>After that they came to the little church
whenever they sundayed in town. With
the trio came others, for they knew they
would be hospitably received. This proved
to the minister that the man who wants a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
larger parish has only to remove the fence
that encloses his present one.</p>

<p>As often as his pressing duties would allow
it, the missionary followed his new
found flock. The distance was great to Kettle
River, yet he walked to the camp that
service might be held on the bank of the
stream. From the memories of the men
who heard and of him who preached, the
pleasure of those sunset gatherings will
never be effaced. Kettle River drive was
more fruitful than preacher or logger
dreamed.</p>

<p>Although Mr. Higgins grew to manhood
in a timber country, yet he never had visited
a large lumbercamp until the winter following
his residence at Barnum. In his youth
he had logged in the forests of Dufferin
County, Ontario, but the lumbering was on
a small scale&mdash;it was only the logging of
farmers. Around Barnum, Minnesota, the
camps were operated by the lumber kings of
the west. The winter's cut was counted in
millions of feet, not by hundreds or thousands.</p>

<p>In the fall of 1895 a delegation of lumberjacks
came to the Sky Pilot's home in Barnum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
and asked to be taken into the circle
of his ministration.</p>

<p>"We need you just as much as the camp
of drivers you preached to in the spring,"
they said, and they looked the part they
professed.</p>

<p>Camp after camp petitioned for his services,
and so the work grew until all the logging
camps around the village were receiving
occasional services from the unordained
man who served the Presbyterian Mission
Church at Barnum. The field was large,
white for a willing harvest, but the laborers
were few, few indeed&mdash;only one.</p>

<p>Mr. Higgins had recently married, and
through the union encouragement and effectiveness
was given to his work in village
and camp. In October of 1895 Mr. Higgins
was married to Miss Eva L. Lucas of Rockford,
Minnesota. Miss Lucas was an active
church worker in her own town, and after
her marriage the bride often went with her
husband to the filthy camps and furnished
music on the little portable organ. Her
presence was appreciated by the foresters,
and with the lead of the organ the music
was bettered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
These were days of exacting labor and
little pay. In his spare moments Frank
Higgins was trying to supplement the loss
of university and seminary training, and
the midnight lamp glowed in the study as
he sought to prepare himself for ordination.
There were sermons to prepare, calls to
make, the dead to bury, and a thousand unexpected
duties that are ever attendant on
a village pastorate. But louder than all the
demands was the ever increasing Macedonian
cry from the camps for services and
assistance. So much to be done and so
little one could do in comparison to the demand!
Frank Higgins never asked for
"flowery beds of ease." His physical
strength was unlimited, and he loved action
rather than repose. With the joy of a
strong man he attacked his work and found
an increasing happiness in duty done. A
few days after one of his visits to the camps,
two lumberjacks came to his door.</p>

<p>"We want you quick," they said, "we've
brought one of the boys from the camp to
his homestead. He's asking for you. He's
a very sick man."</p>

<p>In company with the woodsmen Mr. Higgins
went through the forest to the log cabin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
of the homesteader. The doctor had just
arrived. Turning to Mr. Higgins, the physician
said:</p>

<p>"If we could get him to St. Luke's Hospital
in Duluth there would be a chance
for him. He cannot obtain the necessary
care here in his shack."</p>

<p>Mr. Higgins volunteered to accompany
the sick man. They bundled the patient
snugly into a sleigh, drove to the depot, and
in a short time were in the hospital.</p>

<p>Only a few minutes passed before the
physician in charge came to Mr. Higgins
and said:</p>

<p>"There is no chance for your friend's recovery.
You had better break the news to
him, for he is beyond our help."</p>

<p>Gently, tenderly, the rough camp
preacher told the dying man of his condition
and asked him to make preparation for
the nearing end.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img id="if_illo_053" src="images/illo_053.jpg" width="600" height="359" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption">A SMALL CONGREGATION</div></div>

<p>The lumberjack looked up at the weeping
minister, and smilingly said: "Thank
God you came to the camp that night. I
heard you preach of a Savior, and all my
being longed to know him. It was the first
time in twenty years I had heard the gospel.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
I was raised in a Christian home, and
that night all the lessons of childhood came
back to me. When the lanterns were put
out, and the bunkhouse was silent, I got on
my knees and prayed the forgiving God to
forgive the past, and make me a better
man. That night Jesus Christ brought his
strong salvation to me, and I was forgiven."
He paused through weakness and was still,
then opening his eyes, now clouded with the
mists of death, he looked at the minister.</p>

<p>"Brother Higgins, go back to the camps
and tell the boys of my Savior. Go back
and tell the old story to the lumberjacks.
They need you worse than the towns do.
Tell them of Jesus who can make them live,
go back to the lonely camps." He ceased
to speak. More feebly came the breath, and
soon the spirit returned to the God who
gave it.</p>

<p>The minister was left with a problem
greater than any he had yet attempted to
solve. In the corridors of the hospital he
walked through the long night, carrying a
sense of duty and sacrifice he had never
known before. "Can it be possible that God
wants me to take up this work?" he asked.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
"Has God spoken his will through the dying
man?" Ambition rebelled against the
sacrifice; fond wishes refused to be set aside,
but with every tempting prospect came the
command of the dying man, "Go back to
the boys and carry the story of Jesus." It
sounded clearly. No man could misunderstand
it. That night all his plans were
changed. Ambitions, such as come to all
young men, were swept away. The large
pulpits of which he had dreamed were superseded
by the log or barrel which held
the Bible in the camp services, and the future
audiences were men rough clothed,
rough visaged, who dwelt not in homes of
opulence, but slept in the hay-filled bunks
in the log camps. That night in the hospital
he consecrated himself to the service of
God in the logging camps.</p>

<p>He now began to look about the field in
which his life work was to be done. The
extent of the field and the intensity of the
need was appalling. While there were
Christian men in the camps, and many
whose lives were moral, yet these were few
in comparison to the crowd who wasted
their lives as did the younger son in the
parable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
Ordination was now his great desire, for
he wished to go to the men as one who could
minister to all their spiritual needs. But ordination
was far off. The studies were not
completed, and would not be for several
years.</p>

<p>The spring after his decision, he was surprised
on entering his home to find it filled
with a crew of lumberjacks who were returning
from the camps.</p>

<p>"Mr. Higgins," began the spokesman,
"We've dropped in today to tell you how
we've enjoyed the preaching in our camp.
The boys want me to make a spiel, but the
saw is more in my line. You've treated us
white, have given us more advice than we've
digested, and never asked to see the color of
our money. But this is no one-sided affair.
The boys have all chipped in, and here's
your stake for service rendered." As he
closed he handed the minister a check for
fifty-one dollars.</p>

<p>In all his work the missionary had not
asked for financial assistance. The boys at
first thought he was preaching for "what
there was in it," but when he asked not for
money, they realized that love and devotion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
was the impelling cause. "The lumberjack
is no cheap skate," so they gladly
gave in return.</p>

<p>Through the benevolence of the woodsmen,
Mr. Higgins saw a new possibility.
He was willing to give himself to the work,
but it was necessary that living and incidental
expenses should be met. How to finance
the mission work was the question,
but now he saw the boys would pay a large
part of the attendant expenses if some one
would organize the work. The barriers were
being removed; the doors were opening.
Only, ordination had yet to be received.</p>

<p>The work at Barnum was followed by his
taking charge of a church in New Duluth,
where the mill hands formed a large part
of the population. Acquaintance with the
men and their work led to an interest in
him, and soon the church was on its feet.
The same success that was seen at Barnum
followed the New Duluth work, and after a
short period of labor there, he was asked to
take the Bemidji church. Here in the
heart of the logging district the real work
of his life began, for as never before he
learned the ways of the lumberjack.</p>

<h2 class="vspace"><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a><br />

<span class="subhead">IN THE HEART OF THE LOGGING DISTRICT.</span></h2>

<p>In the spring of 1899, Frank E. Higgins
began his work in Bemidji. The Home
Missions Committee of Duluth Presbytery
had invited him to assist the little group of
Christians in the new town, where assistance
was badly needed, for the place was in the
heart of the logging district, and was infamous
for its traffic in evil. The hosts of
sin were well organized, but righteousness
needed the encouragement of a strong man.</p>

<p>The Bemidji field was first opened to
Christian work by Mr. S.&nbsp;A. Blair, the Sabbath
School missionary of Duluth Presbytery,
in 1896. In those days no railway
reached the place, but the pine forest beckoned
to the logging companies and the Mississippi
river offered an outlet for the logs.
Bemidji could only be reached by following
the rough trails through the swamps
and around the hills from Walker, Minnesota,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
thirty-five miles away. Most of the
supplies were carried up the lakes and rivers
and toted over the portages to the new village.</p>

<p>When Mr. Blair started on his thirty-five
mile tramp to Bemidji, the Baptist denomination
also decided to send a man to organize
for them. But the rains descended and
the floods came, until the poorly made roads
were more impassable than ever. Not relishing
the flooded condition, the immersionist
gave up the task&mdash;for once water interfered
with the Baptist growth. But Mr.
Blair, prior to his conversion, had been a
lumberjack, and none of these things moved
him. Wading the depths and fording the
streams, he at last arrived at the hamlet on
Lake Bemidji, and organized the work.
Later a church was partly built by Mr.
Blair, and occasional services were held. It
was to take charge of this field that Mr. Higgins
turned his steps to the north. He had
seen the conditions of the woodsmen in Barnum
and other towns, yet he needed the Bemidji
experience to show him their real
poverty of soul, and their utter helplessness
in the face of open, alluring vice. Here he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
saw them at their worst, given over to shame,
encouraged in degradation. They were as
sheep without a shepherd, a prey to every
spoiler and evil designer.</p>

<p>It would require one whose ability is far
above mine to pen a picture that would adequately
set forth the low plane of life found
in the early days of Bemidji. Since that
time it has changed for the better, but it is
still influenced by the past and is far from
a moral Utopia. Nature has done everything
to make the place attractive and
restful. Lake Bemidji and Lake Irving
are inviting sheets of water with a
shore line of nearly fifty miles. The
great Father of Waters joins their crystal
bodies, and at the point of meeting
the little city of Bemidji is built. Every
part of the city is pine-covered. Those who
platted the place removed only the larger
trees, and the homes rest in the shelter of
the constant green. Like a huge emerald
in a setting of purest silver is the green
sheltered city with its rippling lakes and
flowing river.</p>

<p>Nature had contributed lavishly, but
when man came he brought with him the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
defects of humanity and painted the fair location
with the blackness of unlicensed vice,
filling the Eden of beauty with the blight
of Sodom. It was a town with a wide open
policy, in which saloons abounded, brothels
flourished and gamblers worked unmolested.
It was known as one of the most shameless
places in the state, and in those
days seemingly lived up to its reputation.
The police force was little more than
a name, for the saloon men were "the powers
that be." It was to the interest of the
liquor men that the town be run as wide
open as possible, and the business interests
as represented by the liquor sellers were far
from the Puritan mould. A convenient
double blind was on Justice. The Law was
roped and thrown. Rum was the real owner
of the town. It was above the Law. It was
master.</p>

<p>Gambling was connected with most of the
saloons and numerous devices were in sight
to attract the indifferent. Not satisfied with
what came to them, the runners of the saloons
and dens went into the camps to drum
up trade for their respective places of business&mdash;creating
a sentiment that would induce
the boys to visit their dens of vice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
The brothels were large and accessible,
being near the center of the town. In one
of the places a large number of negresses
was kept to pander to the bestial instincts
of the men.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to give a description
of those early day conditions. A citizen of
the town remarked, "You can't put enough
black in the picture when you try to paint
the early Bemidji." In justice to the moral
element of the place we must add that there
were always those who strove for better conditions,
and the efforts they made have met
with some success, for the moral conditions
of Bemidji in 1907 are vastly superior to
the conditions at the time of which we
write.</p>

<p>It was early in 1899 when Mr. Higgins
became a resident of Bemidji. The Presbyterian
church had been organized but a
short time, yet it was in a state of coma that
was rapidly passing into death. Only two
members could be found. A church building
had been erected, but because of financial
difficulties it had not been finished and
was far from attractive or comfortable.
Frank Higgins' task was to find the scattered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
adherents, then complete the building.</p>

<p>For want of a more suitable place of residence,
the unfinished edifice became the
meeting place and manse combined. The
few houses obtainable were mostly rude
shacks whose exteriors were covered with
tar paper, instead of weather boards, and
even these temporary structures, poor and inadequate,
were hard to obtain.</p>

<p>During the early part of the Bemidji ministry,
Marguerite, the only child of Mr. and
Mrs. Higgins, came to bless the parents'
hearts and add joy to the missionary home.</p>

<p>The years at Bemidji were strenuous, but
successful. The unfinished edifice was enlarged
and completed during the first year
of the layman's work. The year following
found him building the cozy manse, while
the membership grew with increasing steadiness.
In connection with the church at
Bemidji was a station at Farley, and during
the third year a little chapel was erected
there. By this time the Bemidji congregation
had outgrown the capacity of the building
and in the fourth year a more commodious
and suitable church was built.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
In these full years the camps had not
been neglected. With the erection of the
numerous buildings, to which he had contributed
manual labor as well as superintendence,
Mr. Higgins' hands were seemingly
well filled. In addition to these duties,
however, he every winter gave his personal
attention to nine camps and regularly
visited three of them each week. The seven
addresses a week, the miles between the
camps, and the pastoral calls consumed the
hours, leaving no time for leisure and idleness,
while from all sides came the demands
of the foresters for religious instruction and
services.</p>

<p>One morning when he returned from the
camps, Mrs. Higgins told him of an urgent
call from the Sisters' Hospital. Hastily he
went to the ward and there found Will McDonald,
a Highland Scotchman, at the
point of death. McDonald had met with a serious
accident in the camps. The Sky Pilot
and the teamster were well acquainted. McDonald's
boyhood days were spent among
the bonny hills of the homeland, in a quiet
Christian home. In early manhood he came
to Minnesota and followed the winter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
woods. There, amidst the rough life he forgot
his early instruction and traveled the
ways to which temptation so readily
pointed.</p>

<p>On entering the ward the preacher tried
to cheer the dying man, but the woodsman
turned to him and said:</p>

<p>"It's no use, Frank, the jig is up. I've
got to go. I'm nearing the landing with a
heavy load. Do you think I'll make the
grade?"</p>

<p>He was a teamster and had hauled many
heavy loads up the grade, and now he was
thinking of the unknown way he was traveling
and the possibilities of the journey.</p>

<p>"Yes, you can make the grade, Will, but
you will have to look for help," said the
preacher.</p>

<p>"You mean I'll have to get another team
of leaders to help me up the grade?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"That is it," said Mr. Higgins, "but thank
God, McDonald, you have the greatest
Leader to give you a lift&mdash;the Lord Jesus
Christ. Every man he has helped has made
the grade. Listen, Will, while I read you
something." Taking out his pocket testament,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
he read the story of the prodigal, and
how by the Father's help he made the grade.
Then came the strengthening text setting
forth God's love for a lost world and the
needlessness of perishing. "Turn to him,
Will, and the grade will be easy."</p>

<p>Kneeling by the bed, the missionary prayed
to the loving God for help, asking that the
poor broken prodigal might make the grade
and safely arrive at the heavenly landing.
In the ward the other lumberjacks heard
the prayer, and while the tears fell over
faces unaccustomed to them, the boys uttered
in silence a sympathetic prayer that
Will McDonald might reach the hill-top.</p>

<p>A few hours later Mr. Higgins called
again at the hospital. The screen was
around the bed and by the side sat the sister
of charity with book and beads. The
Sky Pilot knelt by the Scotchman's side,
and when the dying man saw the visitor a
smile came upon his face.</p>

<p>"You're right, Frank, a great Leader is
Jesus Christ. I couldn't have made the
grade without him. I needed his help, and
he is strong. I'm going up the grade easily,
we're going to make it sure."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
A moment more&mdash;the missionary bent
close to catch the words, for McDonald was
passing rapidly away. "Tell the boys I've
made the grade," he whispered, and with a
smile was gone. He had left the valley; the
unfading green of heavenly plains was before
him. He was with the great Leader,
through whose divine strength many a poor
prodigal has made the grade.</p>

<p>The Presbyterian church has always stood
for an educated ministry. The demands it
makes of its candidates for ordination are of
the highest order, and it is well that this
should continue. The system of doctrine
taught by it demands thorough preparation
for the effort of Presbyterianism has ever
been directed to the intellect rather than to
the emotions. It believes that men should
be educated into the Kingdom rather than
persuaded into it.</p>

<p>Ever since the night of consecration in
St. Luke's Hospital, where the dying man
pleaded with him to "go back to the camps
and tell the boys of Jesus Christ," Frank
Higgins had desired to devote all his efforts
to missionary work among the lumberjacks.
He felt that he could labor more successfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
if he went into the camps as an ordained
minister rather than as a layman.
There were many who felt that a layman
could do the work as effectively as an ordained
man, and some even claimed that a
layman could do better work in such a field.
Frank Higgins did not agree with the latter,
and results have proven the correctness of
his judgment. "The lumberjacks want no
flunkey, but the real thing," as one expressed
it. "We don't want a Sunday
school teacher, but a full baked Sky Pilot
who has got all the degrees agoin'." Mr.
Higgins knew this, and wished to go to
them as an ordained man, hence his persistence
in the pursuit of ordination.</p>

<p>Systematic Theology has its difficulties to
the seminarian, but more for him who attempts
to master it alone. This and other
studies composed the task that Presbytery
had placed before Frank Higgins, and it
was necessary that a knowledge of these be
obtained before the coveted "laying-on-of-hands"
be granted. In the presence of his
studies he saw the handicap in which he was
placed through lack of scholastic training,
and with the multitudinous demands of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
large field he lacked the time for mental attainments.
The nearest Presbyterian pastor
was ninety miles away, so he could look for
little assistance from that quarter. He could
not get advice and instruction from others,
he must labor alone.</p>

<p>For seven long years he struggled with
his studies, often with disappointing results
and with the feeling that it would
never be said of him as of Paul, "much
learning doth make thee mad,"&mdash;although
his unsuccessful attempts to acquire the desired
learning threatened to this end. Time
and again the Presbytery refused to grant
the petitioner's request for ordination.
Meeting after meeting he came before them
for examination, but still they did not feel
that they could solemnly set him aside to
the work of the Christian ministry. The action
of the Presbytery must not be misunderstood.
The members saw the lack of
training, the mental defects of the man, the
rough exterior of the petitioner&mdash;for there
was little about him to suggest the pulpit&mdash;and
while they loved and admired the
hearty, consecrated missionary, they hesitated
to confer the rite of ordination upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
him. They were men who knew the standards
of the church and felt that, measured
by the plumb-line of Presbyterian custom,
he did not meet all its requirements. They
were only men, and as such were compelled
to judge by exteriors. It was not strange
that they hesitated, for the sentiment of the
church is against the ordination of men who
have not qualified in the full course. Stones
there are, however, that no contrivance of
man can make to shine, yet they fill a niche
in the building where a glazed surface
would be a conspicuous defect. Such is
Frank Higgins. Try to polish him and he
is still the same, but a rough ashler is as
necessary to the building as a smooth and
perfect one.</p>

<p>One of his examiners asked him, "What
seminary did you attend?"</p>

<p>"I never saw a seminary," he answered.</p>

<p>"What is your college?" was asked.</p>

<p>"My college is the Bible and yonder forest,
as I believe God intended," he replied.
"I do not ask for ordination because I am
qualified by the schools, but because God
calls me, and there is a work waiting for
me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
According to custom, the candidate was
asked to withdraw while the discussion was
held. For three hours the presbyters discussed
his case and when the vote was taken
the desired privilege was withheld.</p>

<p>Later in the session, in his remarks before
the gathering, Mr. Higgins said: "I
need not tell you that the decision of this
body is disappointing, for I have long desired
the boon of ordination. During the
last seven years I have appeared before you
many times, and asked to be set aside to the
ministry. I know my insufficiencies; no
man can know them better. I do not blame
you for with-holding "the-laying-on-of-hands,"
but I was ordained of God long
years ago to preach the unsearchable riches
of Christ, and although unsanctioned by
man, I shall still preach the message with
which he has provided me. I have asked
ordination for the last time. I am satisfied
with the call of God. It is sufficient for
me. I ask no more." While he spoke, the
spirit of God told of the inner life of the
candidate and the brethren saw the consecrated
heart.</p>

<p>At a special meeting held shortly afterwards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
the Presbytery reconsidered its action,
and Frank E. Higgins was ordained.
While the Presbytery had hesitated, it has
never regretted its final action. It has
never ceased to rejoice in the labors of the
determined, undiscouraged man who
amidst manifold labors and difficulties,
worked, waited and prayed seven years, like
Jacob of old.</p>

<p>His oft-repeated prayer for ordination having
been answered, he looked to the camps
as the field of his future endeavor. "Lord,
open the door," he had asked, and the
door was opened. At the time of his ordination
the Bemidji congregation was building
the new church. Mr. Higgins helped in
the manual labor. One day while he was
shingling the tower a boy brought him a
letter requesting him to come to Winona
Lake, Indiana, and consult with the Evangelistic
Committee relative to the conditions
in the logging camps. As a result of the
conference Frank Higgins was commissioned
to take charge of this work in Minnesota.
The appointment was made in August,
1902, and with it came the real opportunity
for which he had waited since the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
night in the hospital. He was going "to tell
the boys of Jesus Christ."</p>

<p>Shortly after his return to Bemidji the
Rev. Frank Higgins took a strange ministerial,
or rather, unministerial vacation. The
woodsmen of winter are farm hands, railroad
constructionists and wanderers in summer,
and Mr. Higgins decided that he would acquaint
himself with the summer life of the
men. His visits to the camps during the
past seven years had already given him a
knowledge of their winter conditions. Donning
the clothes of a laboring man, he
mounted a freight train and started on a
long western trip of quiet investigation. In
western North Dakota he labored for several
days as a harvest hand, meeting many
of the men he had preached to in the Minnesota
camps. From this place he shipped
with a gang of laborers and worked as a
scraperman on a new railway in Montana.
Shortly afterwards he was with the pick and
shovel gang at The Dalles in Oregon, only
to leave and work as a deck hand on a boat
going down the Columbia river. Portland,
Oregon, ended his western trip.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
In all parts of his hobo trip he found the
winter woodsmen, some laboring, some
leisurely passing the warm and sunny days
in idleness. Mr. Higgins visited the larger
churches wherever he stopped and as a workingman
entered their doors to see the reception
they would tender to a man who
apparently belonged to the wanderers. The
trip broadened his experience and gave an
insight into the life of the nomads among
whom he was shortly to take up permanent
work. He saw the life as one who had
lived and experienced a portion of it. He
felt the pangs of hunger, encountered the
slights and rejections, the hardships and
lovelessness to which their lives were subjected,
and out of the knowledge came a
broader sympathy, a more ready ability to
help.</p>

<p>When he returned to Bemidji the new
church was ready for dedication and after a
few weeks he left the pastorate to give himself
wholly to the twenty thousand men of
Minnesota's camps. The field was ready and
he now became in reality, "The Lumberjack
Sky Pilot."</p>

<span class="subhead">THE LUMBERJACK IN THE CAMPS.</span></h2>

<p>A brief description of the camps and of
the camp life will add to the interest of the
reader who is unacquainted with the logging
industry.</p>

<p>When a lumber company contemplates
logging in a given locality, a cruiser is sent
through the forest to estimate the amount
of lumber it will cut. After the report of
the cruiser has been received, a crew of experienced
woodsmen follows, and selects the
place for the camp or camps, and lays out
the logging roads. This latter is not an
easy task, although to the inexperienced it
seems to be, for the road must be as nearly
level as the possibilities of the land will allow.
A hill to be surmounted means a reducing
of the size of the load and an increase
in the cost of hauling; a grade
scarcely enough to be noticed in ordinary
traffic also adds danger and uncertainty to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
the haul. If there is a grade, its descent
must be towards the landing, hence the
need of skilled road-makers. It is in the
early fall of the year that these logging
roads are made. Trees are felled, every
stump is removed and the little hills are leveled
until there appears in the forest a
broad, level, often winding avenue that
suggests a city speedway. When the cold
binding wind of the north has frozen hill
and glen and the swamp lands have become
resistant to the tread, the rut cutter is sent
over the newly made roads. This heavy, unsightly
piece of mechanism cuts a deep
groove or rut in each side of the road. Later
these ruts are partly filled with water and in
the icy track the great runners of the heavy
logging sleds travel with ease and safety.
The logging sleds are huge affairs. The
runners are eight feet long. The weight of
the sled with its chains is about thirty-five
hundred pounds&mdash;a good load in itself under
normal conditions. On these sleds the
logs are hauled to the landing, and from
there pass by stream or rail to the distant
sawmills.</p>

<p>The camp is generally placed near the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
center of the land or on an elevation convenient
to water. The buildings of the camp
consist of a cookshed made large enough
for cooking and dining-room purposes, a
bunkhouse to house the men, a blacksmith
shop, barns and office. All these are built
of logs chinked with clay, and are quite
warm, if properly constructed.</p>

<p>A view of the interior of the cookshed is
always interesting and visitors to the camp
are apt to journey in that direction first of
all, not simply because of appetite, but to
satisfy their curiosity relative to the comforts
of the crew. At one end of the room
stands a large stove. The walls of the place
resemble the interior of a country store,
where all for man or beast is offered to the
buyer. The rest of the space is reserved for
the dining-room, and the tables present the
appearance of a sea of oilcloth. The table
dishes are of tin, but in a few camps enamelware
has very acceptably been introduced.
Substantial iron knives and forks, and unsubstantial
tin spoons are instruments of
adornment and utility. The condiments or
relishes are in boxes of large capacity or in
bottles that once did duty for a favorite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
brand of whisky or a much-lauded patent
medicine. Often the labels remain on the
bottles and the visitor is uncertain as to the
sociability of the place or its unhealthfulness,
and if not enlightened by the knowing
ones he is apt to go without the desired vinegar
or catsup&mdash;unless he is so constituted as
to be ever on the lookout for a chance "to
wet his whistle."</p>

<p>The interior is substantial in appearance,
but not altogether conducive to good appetite.
"We use oleomargarine all the time,"
says a large placard adorning the walls, and
the writer has never doubted the statement;
in fact, he is willing to make an affidavit
that it was used in every camp he visited,
or at least a substitute whose dissembling he
was willing to believe.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img id="if_illo_087" src="images/illo_087.jpg" width="600" height="452" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption">SAID TO BE THE LARGEST LOAD OF LOGS EVER HAULED OUT OF A CAMP, 31.480 FEET</div></div>

<p>"No talking at the tables" is conspicuous
in some camps, and this is probably a wise
precaution for it saves time, keeps the men
from quarreling, and in case the food is not
up to the standard the grumbler is silent
until after he has left the table. But the
food is generally better than the outsider
would expect. It is strong, substantial,
abundant, and of good quality, to which is
added variety. The fastidious would hardly
be satisfied with the service, but it is not intended
for the fastidious. He who labors in
the pine-laden air is not likely to quarrel
with the service if the quality is right and
the quantity abundant. Beef, pork, potatoes,
beans, peas and other seasonable vegetables
form the bill of fare of the camps.</p>

<p>The bunkhouses are large and roomy.
On the long sides of the building double-decked
bunks are built with the ends toward
the center of the room, "muzzle-loaders," the
boys call them. Owing to the unsanitary
conditions, it does not take long to generate
a goodly number of "company," to use the
name by which the woodsmen designate the
vermin. Fortunately, some of the camps are
better kept and the men escape this additional
irritation. A large cylindrical wood-stove
is installed in the center of the room,
and above it is built a rack for drying the
clothes of the men. Since every lumberjack
wears several pairs of socks to keep out
the cold, this rack in the evening holds several
hundred pairs. In the heat of the place
the drying socks begin to blossom, and it
has been noticed by others than botanists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
that roses and socks do not produce a like
aroma. Few of the bunkhouses have any
tables. Water and tin basins are near the
door for the use of those acquainted with
the custom of bathing.</p>

<p>In the office where the clerk, the bosses,
scalers and others of more pretentious occupation
sleep, one corner is set apart for the
wannigan, as the small camp store is called.
Here the workers buy clothing, shoes, tobacco
and the few articles needed in the
camp. The stock is not extensive, but the
price of the articles is far reaching. One
of the clerks said, "I have charge of the
wannigan&mdash;the first graft of the lumberjack."</p>

<p>Where once the timid deer cropped the
tender herbage, the rough camps of the lumbermen
are seen. Before the mighty swing
of the keen blades the solitudes are passing
away. In Minnesota, two billion board feet
of lumber represent the cut of the winter
months, and in the camps and mills almost
forty thousand men are employed. Logging
is an extensive industry, and it has been
brought to a high degree of efficiency in
Minnesota.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
Every day the tote teams pass between the
camps and the village carrying provisions
for man and beast. These teams are the
means of communication between the foresters
and civilization.</p>

<p>Where there are several camps owned by
the same company, the most important personage
is the representative of the company
who is known among the men as the "walking
boss," because he is always passing from
camp to camp, seeing to the interests of the
firm. The "walking boss" gives his orders
to the subordinate boss who has charge of
an individual camp. This subordinate is
known as the "push." Under the "push"
is another who goes by the name of the
"straw push." The camps have their own
nomenclature, and some of the names are
interesting and humorous. The carpenter
is the "wood butcher;" the clerk is the "ink
splasher," or the "bloat that makes the
stroke;" the man who tends the logging
roads and keeps them free from anything
that would interfere with the heavy sleds is
called the "road monkey;" the workman
who keeps the fires in the bunkhouse and
does odd jobs around the camp goes by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
title of "bull cook," because, in the old days
when oxen were used his duty was to see to
their comfort; the missionary is known as
the "sky pilot," and the top-loader is called
the "sky hooker." Besides these named
there are the cook and cookees, skidders,
teamsters, sawyers, swampers, the barn boss
and the blacksmith.</p>

<p>"In the works" where the trees are felled,
the men work in crews. The sawyers bring
the giants to the earth and the swampers
clear the trunk of its branches and make the
openings through which the logs are drawn
to the skidways. After the tree has fallen,
a man called the "punk hunter" examines
it to see if it be sound and marks the dimensions
into which the log is to be sawn.</p>

<p>The loads hauled from the skidways to
the landings average differently in the
camps, owing to the condition of the roads.
Where the roads are the best the amount
drawn by two or four horses is almost incredible.
In 1905 a load of logs was hauled
into Tenstrike, Minnesota, which scaled
over twenty thousand feet. One of the
camps situated near Shell Lake, Wisconsin,
is said to have hauled the largest load of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
logs ever drawn out of a camp by four
horses. The load contained thirty-one
thousand four hundred and eighty feet. A
thousand feet in the green log, with its attendant
slabs and bark, will weigh nearly
eight thousand pounds. The above figures
will give some idea of the great weight of
the loads, and also of the perfection to
which the road-making must be carried to
make such results possible.</p>

<p>Into these camps with the coming of winter
the lumberjacks crowd. "Why is it that
they are willing to go into isolation and
hardship?" you ask. We can only answer,
"Why does the sailor go down to the sea
in ships?" It seems to get into the blood.
Douglas Malloch, in "The Calling of the
Pine," says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<span class="i0">"When I listen to the callin' of the pine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I drink the brimmin' cup of forest wine&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the path of life is sweet to my travel-weary feet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I listen to the callin' of the pine."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There are lots of men who have followed
the camps from boyhood. I met one man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
who had spent forty-four winters in the
woods and his brother almost as many. It
had become a second nature to them and
the lure of the camps was irresistible.</p>

<p>In the towns and villages adjacent to the
camps the lumberjacks are seen at their
worst because civilization only welcomes
them to its vices; in the camps the woodsmen
are seen at their best because the causes
of their depravity are absent. These big,
hearty fellows may be strong in vices, but
they are by no means lacking in virtues.
They have their code of honor, and the man
who departs from it will find it necessary
to depart from the camp. Depraved as are
most of them, yet in many ways they command
the respect of the men who are acquainted
with their better natures.</p>

<p>The old lumberjack will not tolerate the
least word of slander against a good woman.
If she is entitled to his respect she is entitled
to his defense. He may be steeped
in vice himself, but he esteems those whose
lives are clean, and a good woman appeals
to his chivalry. A woman is as safe in the
camps as in her own home; her purity is
her protection and his respect goes out to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
her. The Sisters of Charity go through the
camps soliciting for the hospitals and
schools. Between the camps they are often
miles from any habitation and when night
overtakes them they sleep in the camps. I
have never heard of one of them being molested
in these lonely trips, and among the
rough, profane foresters they are as safe as
behind the carefully locked doors of the
convent. The lumberjack who would molest
one of them, or any good woman, would
probably not leave the camp alive. Shielded
by her womanhood, she is safe even among
the men who are foreign to restraint.</p>

<p>On one occasion a camp foreman with
his wife entered the caboose of a logging
train. In the car a number of men were
drinking. The bottle was passed around
and all drank, the foreman included. As
the bottle went the rounds it was offered to
the foreman's wife, but scarcely had the
bottle been extended to her when the husband
floored the donor with his fist and
proceeded to kick him out of the car. He
was not going to allow any man to treat his
wife as a woman of the street.</p>

<p>In the settling of disputes, nature's weapons
are the sole instruments used. The fist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
is the arbiter, although the boot is sometimes
called into exercise. The gloves and
wrestling help to pass many lonely hours,
but sometimes these friendly bouts generate
a battle in which hate is the ruling passion.
Fights due to personal animosity are to be
expected where men are free from the restraints
of civilization. In one of the camps
an ex-convict worked and for some unknown
reason made life unbearable to a
pleasant, easy-going Irishman. The ex-convict
was ever trying for a fight, but the
Irishman's blood was more sluggish than
that of the average son of Erin. At last the
attacks were more than the peace-loving fellow
could stand. (How does the proverb
read? "Beware of the wrath of the silent
man.") He went to his bunk and put on
his spike boots and rushed out to meet the
ex-convict. With a blow of his fist he floored
the former prisoner and, beside himself
with rage, kicked him until the body of his
tormentor was a bloody jelly. Had not the
loggers interfered the ex-convict would have
been murdered. The wounded man was
taken to the hospital, where he remained
for several weeks, and on recovering he left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
for other parts, to the satisfaction of all concerned.</p>

<p>Though the labor is hard and the hours
long, for the men are at work when the sun
appears and it is dark when they leave the
works, yet there is a constant variety in
their lives. It takes little to amuse them,
and less to make them "jump their jobs."
The lumberjack is not apt to complain when
things go wrong, but rather to walk into the
office and demand his wages, after which he
will proceed to another camp. Sometimes a
whole camp will suddenly leave because of
some imposition or provocation that may in
itself seem slight. One of the men last winter
"took the cake" in this. He went into
the cookshed for his breakfast, but being a
little late found that the pancake dough was
all gone and there were no cakes for him.
He immediately went to the clerk and demanded
his wages. Here is another case:</p>

<p>Something had gone wrong and Jack Olson
was ready to leave the camp. He proceeded
to the office and demanded the
amount due him, but the clerk was a surly
bully and in reply tossed the little Norwegian
out of the office. Against such physical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
tactics Olson felt he could do nothing,
so he sat around the bunkhouse until his
bunkmate returned from the works.</p>

<p>"The bloat wouldn't give you your stake,
hey?" said bunky.</p>

<p>"And he kicked me out of the office,"
added Olson.</p>

<p>Bunky was interested, very interested.
His eyes twinkled as he thought of the
splendid opening the action of the clerk had
given him for a little added excitement.</p>

<p>"Come on, John, old boy," he said, affectionately
taking Olson by the waist and
leading him to the office. "Come on and
watch the free show while the bloat makes
out your check and mine."</p>

<p>Arriving at the office, bunky entered it
with a jar.</p>

<p>"Sit down there, John, in that reserved
seat while I raise the curtain and turn on
the red fire."</p>

<p>Stepping close to the clerk, Olson's husky
bunkmate shook his monstrous fist under
the nose of the astonished time-keeper, and
said:</p>

<p>"Are you the guy that splashes ink?
Then sprinkle out my walk and do it infernally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
quick. Sprinkle out Olson's, too,
and if you don't hurry this little shack will
look like Hades upset. Splash the ink blank
lively or I'll make a blotter out of you."</p>

<p>Without a word the "guy that splashes
ink" began his work and the walks were
sprinkled out in record time. Bunky and
Olson left the office with the air of victorious
generals and traveled to the nearest town
to blow in the stake in fitting celebration.</p>

<p>Card playing is a great time killer in
some of the camps and when the towns are
not accessible the woodsmen often spend the
whole of the Sabbath playing with the
greasy cardboards. Some of the proprietors
do not allow card playing and they say the
prohibition has caused a more peaceful
state. Since the Logging Camp Mission now
distributes large quantities of literature a
number of the workmen spend their spare
moments in reading.</p>

<p>Many of them will discuss spiritual matters,
and in language that is shockingly contrasted
with the subject, for so habituated
are they to profanity that it does not appear
to the speaker as in the least incongruous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
After one of the meetings it was discovered
that Mr. Higgins had left a hymn book.
The forgotten book fell into the hands of a
lumberjack who could read music and who
possessed a good voice. The following evening
he began to sing the hymns and the
camp gathered to listen.</p>

<p>"That's a d&mdash;n fine song," said the singer
enthusiastically, "the show don't reach it,
not by a Hades of a sight."</p>

<p>He sang another and remarked on closing,
for the sentiment of the song appealed
to him:</p>

<p>"How the devil do they think of such fine
things? It's the prettiest little son of (the
nameless) that I ever heard." This was
said admiringly, and with the intention of
expressing appreciation, but the habit of the
man was profane and he knew not how to
express his feelings unless with verbal gestures.</p>

<p>Profanity is so common to some of them
that they seem to swear with every breath
they draw. An old-timer told the writer
of an incident he had witnessed. They were
loading cars with a steam jammer. The
sky-hooker, or top-loader, who was exceptionally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
profane, was at his post on the top
of the car. One of the logs did not come
up in the way that suited him and he broke
into a stream of profanity that startled even
the lumberjacks. The sky-hooker ended his
profanity with a direct appeal to all the Persons
of the God-head&mdash;a most unspeakable
oath.</p>

<p>"It was the most blasphemous sentence I
ever heard," said the old-timer, "and we
stood around startled." Less than ten minutes
afterwards the hook broke, and an enormous
log weighing several tons crushed the
body of the hooker to pulp. "The Father
had answered," reverently remarked the
woodsman. "I used to swear in those days
but I never have since."</p>

<p>If you wish to meet generous-hearted fellows,
visit the logging camps. Anyone who
has dealings with the lumberjacks will testify
to the truth of the above statement.
The typical lumberjack is large-hearted,
touched with generous impulse and responsive
in his desire to ameliorate suffering.
Often he will impoverish himself to give to
the causes that help humanity. Money is of
little value to him; it only represents the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
power of producing a short-lived pleasure,
and he is therefore willing to share with
others that they may be happy. As the following
incidents will illustrate:</p>

<p>One of the men had taken his family to
the camp and built a little shack in
which to house them during the winter. Mr.
Higgins had held services in the camp, and
the logger requested him to baptize their
baby when he next visited them. Happening
to be in the city shortly afterwards the
missionary mentioned the fact of the coming
baptism and the ladies of the church in
which he was speaking thought they would
contribute to the happiness of the occasion
by sending the baby a bundle of clothing.
The missionary presented the package after
the baptismal service was concluded and the
parents hastened to view the contents.</p>

<p>A crowd of campmen had been invited to
witness the christening of "our kid," as they
called the baby, and when they saw that the
articles sent to the child were second-hand
garments their wrath kindled. "Our kid"
was insulted and every man resented it.</p>

<p>"We're no paupers," they cried. "What
do the city folks mean by insulting the kid
with duds like these?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
"That kid has got to have the best glad
rags. No make-overs for him."</p>

<p>A collection was immediately taken, and
every generous soul cast in his two bits so
that the kid of the camp could hold up his
head.</p>

<p>B&mdash;&mdash; R&mdash;&mdash; was taken sick and had to leave
the camp. For a year disease held him in
its grip. He was a man of family, having
a wife and seven children who were dependent
on his labors. Death visited the home
and took one of the children, adding to the
financial burden. The news of the family's
needs came to Wilson Bros.' Camps 2 and 3,
and immediately ninety dollars was raised
and sent to Mr. R&mdash;&mdash; to help him along. The
boys were willing to respond and gave
gladly.</p>

<p>Many a poor fellow has found true charity
among these men, for their hearts are
large and given to generosity. The dead
lumberjack does not find a corner in the
potter's field, the boys see that he is decently
interred; the sick do not often fall on the
community, for they are helped by their
fellows. Say what you will about the lumberjack,
but put the grace of charity to his
credit, and let it cover a multitude of sins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
There is little chance for personal cleanliness
in the camps. No facilities are there
for bathing unless one is willing to do so
in the presence of the whole camp; the clothing
is often worn much longer than is conducive
to health, and many of the things
we consider so essential are missing, yet few
of the men are affected with sickness. Unsanitary
are the surroundings, but the hours
in the pure air and the hard, active lives of
the workers seem to counteract the disease-breeding
conditions. Most of the cases that
go to the hospitals are due to accidents
rather than to disease. Accidents are all too
common in the camps. Felling the large
trees is never without hazard and the loading
of the logs is more dangerous still. The
heavy hauling adds an element of uncertainty,
particularly where there are grades
to be run on the way to the landing. It
requires skill to let a load down the grade.
This is done by means of sand or hay being
placed in the ruts so that the runners of the
sled are retarded in the descent, but if the
load be checked suddenly it will cause the
logs to shift, endangering the life of man
and beast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
From what has been written in the foregoing
chapters we do not desire to convey
the impression that all the campmen are
depraved and sunken in vice. There are all
kinds and conditions of men among them.
Many of them have been well educated,
have come from homes of refinement and
ease, but through adversity have gone to
lower plains of life. Others have followed
the woods from youth and feel that they are
not fitted for any other class of labor, yet
amidst surroundings that tempt to viciousness
they have kept their moral virtues with
scrupulous care.</p>

<p>The campmen are a neglected class of
men. No one has in past years tried to
touch them with the elevating power of
good. They are what they are because their
labors have isolated them from civilization
and its agencies for good, while the vices of
the provinces have followed them because
there were dollars to be gained. The railway
men of a few years ago were almost in
the same condition as the lumberjacks of today.
The saving power to the railroader
was the restraint that their homes cast about
them, and through their homes the gospel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
and other adjuncts of civilization were possible,
but these are men who are separated
from their homes or unblessed with home
ties. When Christian indifference was supplanted
with Christian activity a change was
soon noted among the workers on the railroad
and they became a respectable class of
men, of whom the nation is justly proud.
<span class="locked">Y. M. C. A.s</span> were established for their
benefit, missions were opened where they
congregated, the church held out its hand
in welcome, and under the stimulus of gospel
encouragement they arose. But what has
been done for the lumberjack? Almost
nothing. In the camps he works through
the dreary, cruel winter, and when he returns
to civilization in the spring only the
hand of the depraved is extended in welcome.</p>

<span class="subhead">A VIEW OF THE CAMP SERVICES.</span></h2>

<p>"The woods were God's first temples." I
cannot pass through the pineries, beholding
the long fingers of cooling green pointing to
the eternal blue, without feeling an exaltation
of spirit, a desire to praise the Creator.
The shrub and towering tree, the aisles of
the woods and the sweet soothing comfort
of the silence all conduce to prayer and
adoration. No temple is more suggestive of
worship than that whose dome is of sheltering
leaves and whose columns are living,
graceful trees. But the camps are the destroyers
of the primitive temples, and their
denizens are not suggestive of devoutness;
yet in the rude hewn shacks of the lumberjacks
nature is heard speaking and her voice
is persuasively calling to worship. In the
gray of dawn her call is clear and sweet, and
as the loggers tighten their heavy belts and
view the new-born day she whispers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
"Praise." In the busy noon day, amidst the
bruised and broken tops, the playing winds
repeat the echo of the morning, "Praise."
Then when the hush of evening falls o'er
the dying day and the purple of the west
shows through the crown of richest green,
the evening shadows take up the chorus,
"Praise him for his goodness, for his love
to the children of men."</p>

<p>On visiting a camp for the first time
Frank Higgins is apt to inquire, "Ever had
any preachers up this way?"</p>

<p>"No. Nobody cares whether we make the
landing in Hades or not," is likely to be the
answer.</p>

<p>"Preachers are only after the stake," said
one. "They don't care for us poor devils.
Heaven was made for the rich, and not for
us lumberjacks. We're only welcome down
the slide."</p>

<p>"Well, here is one who isn't after the
stake," replied the minister, "and his interest
is in the lumberjack."</p>

<p>"Where is the guy? I'd like to meet
him," remarked the woodsman, evidently
thinking such a preacher must be an unknown
variety.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
"I'm the fellow," returned the missionary,
"and I'll prove it by preaching in the bunkhouse
tonight. What time will suit? 7:30,
you say? Well, let all the boys know and
come prepared to sing. That's your part of
the service."</p>

<p>The Rev. Frank Higgins has not much
suggestion of "the cloth" about him. If you
met him on the logging road there is nothing
in his dress to stamp him as a minister,
but everything to proclaim him a lumberjack.
His dress is that of his parishioners,
mackinaw jacket, belt, boots, socks and cap
suggest the logger. His physical appearance
is in keeping with the camp; he is broad-shouldered
and built for endurance. He is
not a tall man, being but five feet nine or
ten, but his weight is two hundred pounds
of muscle. He does not look the preacher,
but ask the lumberjacks about it and they
will tell you "there is no other."</p>

<p>The supper is over and the men have
crowded into the bunkhouse where the
meeting is to be held. What an audience!
It is cosmopolitan; the ends of the earth
have contributed, except the far east. All
classes and conditions are in the group, evidences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
of the best and worst, but on all of
them the stamp of isolation&mdash;they are far
from the accustomed haunts of men, and
everything proclaims it. Sixty to one hundred
and sixty men are in the log shack.
The benches at the end of the bunks are
filled with waiting men, the bunks above
contain many who are lounging in attitudes
of individual fancy. No straight, erect or
formal audience is this; it is as free as the
forest air, as informal as Eden, but not so
cleanly. The congregation is coatless, collarless,
often bootless, for probably half of
them are in their stocking feet, while the
temporarily discarded boots are heaped
around the huge stove to dry. Pipes send
forth long streams of smoke, and in various
parts of the room card games are in progress.
Extra lanterns hang around the shack,
sending out a dim uncertain light that only
partly dissipates the gloom of the interior.
The cylindrical stove contains the crackling
logs and the emitted warmth is the only note
of cheer. The rank odor of cheap tobacco
mingles with the nauseating aroma of the
myriad socks hung above the stove and the
poorly ventilated place is stifling, oppressive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
and depressing. Everything is unsuggestive
of the sanctuary, but the Father of men
meets with his children in the heavy smelling
bunkhouse the same as in the bright,
costly cathedral.</p>

<p>Behind the upturned barrel, whose altar
cloth is a coarse horse blanket, stands the
preacher. No Genevan gown lends its grace
to his figure, but coatless he stands, an earnest
man, physically fearless, powerful in the
love for God and man. The hymnbooks
have been passed around, some familiar
hymn is announced and the command to
sing is given. Not such music as kisses the
ear of the worshiper in the fashionable
churches, where the trained voices blend in
superb harmony, is the music in the camps.
It lacks in sweetness, but is not deficient in
volume and heartiness.</p>

<p>Scripture is read, or rather recited, for it
is nearly impossible to read in the dim light
emitted by the lanterns, then the Sky Pilot
tells what the gospel can do for the loggers
and what the Christ can accomplish in them.
He speaks plainly of their wasted lives, the
folly of spending their money in the saloons,
in gambling dens, in brothels, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
points them to Christ, who can keep a man
from all that links him to the pit.</p>

<p>Do the men listen to the story of the
Savior? Yes, with an interest that can only
come from soul-starved men. They have
been feeding on the husks, have known the
companionship of swine in the form of men
and vampires who resembled women, have
wanted love and found only vice; so they
listen gladly to the news of another life, another
world, another love that is clean and
pure. Their dreams have been of heaven,
but their lives have been lived in hell, and
the Sky Pilot's story seems to make the
dream attainable.</p>

<p>I well remember a sermon he preached
on the Prodigal Son, but the environment
must be present if one is to reproduce the
sermon. It was well suited to the audience,
plain, too plain for a city audience, but an
unmistakable message for the men of the
forest. Figures of speech had little place
in it; of poetry there was little except the
poetry of direct simplicity; it was unadorned
Anglo-Saxon with the crash and clang of
the language in its strength, but it was a
story full of love, hope and cheer that appealed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
to the hundred men who breathlessly
listened while the wind of winter beat the
drifting snow against the camp.</p>

<p>Here are some extracts given wholly from
memory:</p>

<p>"One of the boys stayed at home and one
left the old homestead. Now it wasn't the
fellow that stayed at home that the father
was worrying about, but the fellow that
packed his "turkey" and went out to blow his
stake. You lumberjacks are in that youngster's
place and the old folks are wondering
where you are and what you are doing. Because
a man leaves home it isn't necessary
to be a prodigal, but his chances to make a
fool of himself are better if he is away from
the old home and its memories."</p>

<p>Then came the story of his own home-leaving
and how the mother watched him
until the turn in the road hid him from
view.</p>

<p>"That mother's prayers have followed me
through life. My story is yours with the
names changed. Some one wants to hear
that you still live. Write a letter tonight.</p>

<p>"Because the fellow had money he found
friends, but there never was a friend worth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
having who was made or bought through
money. This young fellow in the parable
reminds me of the lumberjack coming down
the river in the spring and landing in one of
the logging towns. Men who have never
heard of him become his friends at once;
the barkers of the dens wait at the train to
give him the glad hand; he has friends galore
and is the most popular man that enters
the town&mdash;he has money. Then they bleed
him to a finish, as they did the prodigal in
the Bible. There are men in these towns
who have your wages figured up already and
they smile and chuckle as they toast their
shins at the base burner, thinking what a
good time they will have with your money
when you come down in the spring. Don't
think you are working for yourselves; the
saloonmen and their crowd are the ones who
cash your checks and bank your coin. Some
of the men in the saloon business that came
to these parts when I did and were as poor
as I am, are now living in the finest houses
in the north and eat the best the land affords.
The wives of these men are dressed
in silks, and their hands and necks glisten
with the jewels you bought with your winter's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
labor&mdash;but you still wear the coarse
socks and haven't a cent in the bank. Now,
men, were you ever invited into the homes
you built for the saloonmen, gamblers and
brothel keepers? Were you ever given an
introduction to the wives whom you dressed
in silks and jewels? No, and you never will
be. They don't want you; they are after
your cash. That's how they treated the
prodigal of old; that's how they treat the
prodigal lumberjack of today.</p>

<p>"Well, after awhile the prodigal was
broke and he asked his friends for a lift, but
his friends weren't in the lifting business. It
was their business to help him to spend, but
not to spend for him. Do you remember
when you had spent all at the bar, the
wheel, or the brothel, how you asked a loan
for a lodging of the man in whose till your
winter's earnings rested, and he gave you
a hunch to go up river and earn more?
Well, the prodigal was in the same boat, for
they said to him as they said to you, 'Go up
the river, old man. It's the husks and the
hogs for you now.'</p>

<p>"But when the men who rob and spoil
will not give you a hand, the Father will.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
In the father's home was the only place the
prodigal found a hearty reception, and in
the Lord Jesus Christ you will find a welcome."</p>

<p>Then came the gospel message with its
cheer and loving hope, the story of how God
gave Christ to die that the prodigal might
have light and love, and how through him
the homestead opens, where love undefiled
and almighty help is given unstintedly.</p>

<p>It was a homely sermon, a plain message,
a description of life they too well understood
because they had too often experienced
it. Many a head was bowed in shame as
the story of the prodigal's life was told, for
the listeners knew it was a tale, not of the
times of Christ, but taken from their own
lives. When the preacher spoke of the loving
Father who warmly welcomes the wanderers
there was expectancy in the faces of
the auditors.</p>

<p>It was after Mr. Higgins had preached
this sermon on a former occasion that a
young man came to him for a private conversation.
The sermon had awakened a
longing for a better life in which real love
was to take the place of shame. He had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
been carried back to the old home, and
heard the mother praying for the absent
boy.</p>

<p>"Pilot," he said, "I want to pray for myself.
Tell me how and I'll do it."</p>

<p>"Come on, my boy," said the Pilot, "and
under the pines we'll pray together."</p>

<p>Out under the tall sentinels they went,
and there on the frozen snow they knelt
while the prayers of the minister and the
lumberjack ascended to the ever-approachable
throne.</p>

<p>The next day the lad wrote home to his
old mother in Quebec, telling her of his
hope in Christ and his new relation to God.
She had not heard from him in months, and
now the news he sent made her join in the
raptures of the angel chorus. Immediately
she wrote a letter of gratitude to Mr. Higgins
and when the missionary read, "For
this my son was dead and is alive again, he
was lost and is found," he saw a new figure
in the parable&mdash;it was the prodigal's mother.</p>

<p>After the meeting is over and the shack
is lighted only by the stray gleams that steal
through the chinks of the stove, some of the
men will continue to talk to the minister of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
their far-off homes and the loved ones they
have not seen for years. The years are reviewed
and there is a wish that life were
different. By the burning fires of the bunkhouse
many a long closed heart has been
opened and many a life surrendered to God.</p>

<p>Sometimes a man will come to Mr. Higgins
after the services and invite the missionary
to sleep with him in the bunkhouse.
Since the missionaries are generously accorded
the privileges of the office by almost
all of the proprietors, the invitation of the
lumberjack is one that holds in itself no
allurement. The bunks in the sleeping
quarters of the men are often filled with
small annoyances that are fruitful and multiply
and disturb the occupants of the bunks.
But when such an invitation is given the
missionary seldom refuses it. He knows
that the man who gives it means more than
to share the discomforts of his lodging&mdash;he
wishes to get near the messenger so that in
the darkness and quiet he can secure spiritual
aid. In the bunks men have been
helped over difficulties and have freely surrendered
themselves to the Divine Son.
There may be distasteful things to encounter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
but the chance to help a man is worth
more than the sacrifice of comfort.</p>

<p>It was after a camp service that a young
man came to the Pilot and asked:</p>

<p>"Isn't there any way that I can make my
life count? I'm sick of going on this way,
Pilot. I'm sledding in the wrong direction.
Tonight I'm disgusted, so give me a lift."</p>

<p>As a result of the lift he was led to God
and encouraged to save his money for future
schooling. During the evenings of that
winter the young man spent his time in
study and when spring came a large part
of his earnings were deposited in the bank.
The following summer he procured work in
the saw mill and books were the companions
of his leisure hours. So absorbed did he
become in his new purpose that he carried
his book to the mill and when the machinery
stopped to make repairs out came the
book. The proprietor of the mill observed
the diligence of the new hand and changed
him to the sawdust pile where he could have
more time for his books. So absorbed would
he become that often he allowed the sawdust
to take care of itself. The men called
him "the book worm in the sawdust."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
School followed his winter's work, and now
he is a successful civil engineer. In the
bunkhouse on the night of his surrender a
soul and a life were saved.</p>

<p>That sweet old favorite hymn, the favorite
of the home and prayer meeting, the
source of comfort in the house of mourning,
is the favorite in the camps&mdash;"Jesus, Lover
of My Soul." Those unloved men of the
distant places feel the influence of the
hymn which speaks of the tender Christ
opening his bosom to the outcast as well as
the respected. Its plaintive melody appeals
to them, and the lonely men of the forest
sing it with the spirit of those who long for
sympathy and unselfish love.</p>

<p>The night before they had sung the old
song over and over again. The whole camp
had joined in with hearty spirit. After the
breakfast was over the men went to the
bunkhouse to wait for the word of the
"push" ordering them to the morning's labor
in the works. While they waited one
of the men who possessed a rich tenor voice
struck up the hymn, "Jesus lover of my soul,
Let me to thy bosom fly." One by one the
men joined in the song, and the solo passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
into a chorus of one hundred voices. Out
through the twilight of the morning the
melody rolled, waking the sleeping pines
and crossing the frozen streams. The men
in the stables, harnessing their horses, heard
the song and softly whistled it; the cook,
busy with his pots and pans, hummed in
unison, and the swearing cookee closed his
profane mouth and listened in wonder.
Over in the office where the proprietor and
others of the higher grade of labor made
their quarters, the song caused silent amazement,
for it did not seem like the morning
hour of the camp, where usually only profane
sounds break the stillness.</p>

<p>"Other refuge have I none, Hangs my
helpless soul on Thee," sang the men.
"Leave, ah, leave me not alone," and it
came from the hearts of men who knew the
weight of lonely weeks and months. The
Sky Pilot in the office turned his face to the
wall and prayed while they sang.</p>

<p>"All out," cried the "push," and from the
bunkhouse streamed the men, singing the
song of comfort. Into groups they separated,
each going his appointed way, but the
song still continued in all parts of the forest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
until the sweet melody of the hymn
died to tender murmurs and was lost in the
distant evergreens. In all that north state
no happier body of men went forth to toil,
for with them went the spirit of the song.</p>

<p>Sometimes disturbances mar the meetings.
But they are not as frequent as in the early
days, when it was considered the proper
thing in some camps to create a row. The
earnestness of the man and the strength of
his body has gained respect for this teacher
of righteousness. The work, also, is better
understood and a realization of the value of
missionary effort has brought about a
change in sentiment. When Mr. Higgins
first began his work he used a little muscular
Christianity as well as persuasion in regulating
the deportment of the men during
the services; now he has learned a better
way. The Frenchman who undertook to
create a rough house, and suddenly found
himself standing on his head in a barrel of
water, having been put there by the Rev.
Frank Higgins, will not feel like disturbing
one of his services again. The persuasion
of a man who can physically take care of a
religious gathering is a great incentive to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
undisturbed worship, even though the meeting
be held in the forest.</p>

<p>The day after the meeting is the time for
personal work, for hand-picked fruit, for
heart-to-heart conversations. While the
service is in progress the quick eye of the
evangelist singles out those who are most
receptive to the word of life, and on the
morrow he goes to assist by private word the
work done in the public meeting. From the
clerk he finds where they are working in the
forest and goes to join them in their labors.
Here is where the finely developed body
comes into play for the King. One of the
secrets of aiding workingmen is to understand
their labors; they admire the man
who is capable in their individual line, and
Frank Higgins is a woodsman who knows
how to swing the ax and pull the saw. While
working with them he talks of Christ and
tries to draw the worker to him.</p>

<p>In the bunkhouse, during one of the
services, an old man sat in his bunk with
his little nondescript dog in his lap. Loneliness
was written on his deep-lined face;
while the others sang he was silent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
"Don't you sing?" asked the missionary,
handing him a book.</p>

<p>"None of your blank business," gruffly
mumbled the old man.</p>

<p>All through the service the old fellow was
silent, seemingly hearing no word of the
sermon. The next day the missionary went
to the "ink splasher" and inquired where
the old man could be found.</p>

<p>"That's Old Grouchy. He's the road
monkey and you'll find him on the east
road about this time of day," directed the
clerk.</p>

<p>"Good morning," was the greeting of the
missionary as he came up to the road monkey.</p>

<p>"Mornin'," answered Old Grouchy, in
non-committal tones.</p>

<p>"Your roads are in fine shape, almost perfect,"
said the missionary, sparring for an
opening.</p>

<p>"Bad, infernally bad," answered the road
monkey.</p>

<p>"Like the job?" asked the preacher to encourage
conversation.</p>

<p>"Yes, the way the damned like their
lodgings," burst out Old Grouchy. "But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
what is it to you whether I like it or not?
You can't change it."</p>

<p>Before the preacher could make reply the
little dog came out of the woods, where he
had been in pursuit of a pine squirrel, and
came to the minister for attention. It was
a dog of many breeds, but the road monkey's
eyes fell upon it lovingly and the
minister saw the look.</p>

<p>"A good friend of yours, I suppose," said
the Sky Pilot.</p>

<p>"The only friend I have," and the tone
was soft and reflective.</p>

<p>The minister knew that he had found the
opening to the old man's heart and began
to talk of his own dog team, the faithfulness
and intelligence of the animals and the
companionship they freely gave. Old
Grouchy joined in the conversation and
discussed with freedom the love he felt for
the dumb creatures. From this they drifted
to matters more personal until the whole
story of the man's life was narrated and the
cause of his cynicism was bared.</p>

<p>It was a story of startling disappointment,
of a home wrecked through unfaithfulness
and broken trust. No man could hear the
story and remain unsympathetic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
"No wonder you see the world darkened,"
said the preacher; "if I had your experience
I might feel as you do today."</p>

<p>The missionary talked to the man and
tried to lead him to the bright paths of
peace, but nothing appealed to the sad soul
of the lonely man. The gospel gave him
no hope, the sun was set, and all was covered
with the curtains of night. God to him
was dead and in all the world the only love
he knew was the dumb affection of the forlorn
yellow dog.</p>

<p>When Mr. Higgins went back to that
camp in later days the road monkey would
listen attentively to the presentation of the
loving Christ and seemed to wonder if it
were possible that God could care for him.</p>

<p>"Sing, brother," said the missionary. But
the old man only shook his head. He
would not sing. Nay! he could not. His
heart strings were withered; melody had left
him through the unfaithfulness of woman.
He had passed into the starless night where
no glimmer of hope entered, and in his
solitude he caressed his little dog and perhaps
wondered if the great God cared, if
any being was interested in him besides the
faithful little animal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
The Rev. Frank Higgins was preparing
for the evening service. He had rolled the
barrel into the center of the room where it
was to do duty as a pulpit. The proprietor
of the camp came in and seeing the barrel,
but not knowing its intended purpose, appropriated
it as a seat. Not wishing to disturb
the proprietor, Mr. Higgins stood by
his side and conducted the service.</p>

<p>The place was well filled and the interest
was intense. The men entered heartily into
the singing, and when the sermon came it
was full of keen home thrusts. The errors
of the lumberjacks were pointed out with
freedom and a remedy forced with conviction.
The proprietor sitting on the pulpit
enjoyed the straightforward way in which
the preacher dealt with the lumberjacks,
and at every telling shot heartily applauded
and added some words of encouragement to
the speaker.</p>

<p>"Now you're getting them, Higgins; keep
the chips a-flying. Give them another
whirl, Pilot; you have them where the hide
is thin." With these and other suggestions
he added his encouragement.</p>

<p>It happened that while the proprietor was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
a man whose record as a logger was one of
the best in the state, being able to get out
his logs where others would fail, yet his
morals were far below his business reputation.
His son was following in his footsteps,
much to the sorrow of the mother and the
disgust of the father.</p>

<p>After the proprietor had applauded several
times and given his advice as to the
style of preaching suited to the lumberjacks,
Mr. Higgins turned his guns on the proprietors,
contractors and foremen for the example
some of them set before the men.</p>

<p>"I do not wonder that you lumberjacks
live shameless lives, for the leaders of the
work often set you the worst examples.
Some of the proprietors, contractors and
bosses are to be found drinking, gambling
and carousing in the villages and towns, and
they who should lead you into better things
are only examples of riot and immorality.
They are your examples and you are responding
to them."</p>

<p>The proprietor sat silent.</p>

<p>"Why don't you applaud that sentiment
also?" asked the preacher of the proprietor.
"It's just as true as the others."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
When Mr. Higgins went into the office
that night the proprietor was there, and as
he entered the logger looked up and said:
"That was pretty blank plain, Pilot."</p>

<p>"I always preach so the audience will understand
me," replied the minister.</p>

<p>"But you needn't have shouted the whole
blank thing before the crowd," returned the
proprietor.</p>

<p>"I didn't tell them a thing but what they
already knew, Mr. Blank. The boys know
how you are living and that your son is following
pretty close in your footsteps. It's
time to call a halt, for you can't be proud
of the example you're setting."</p>

<p>Before the missionary left the camp the
proprietor came and thanked him for not
only fearlessly preaching to the lumberjacks
but for being equally ready to preach to the
lumber kings.</p>

<p>While many refuse the word of life, yet
the seed sown often springs up in later days
to show that a dormant seed may yet come
to fruitage.</p>

<p>One who had often attended the services
came to no decision as the result of the sowing.
Shortly afterwards he was seriously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
hurt and carried to the hospital. Mr. Higgins
visited him and tried to bring him to a
decision. Since there was no hope of recovery
he was carried to his Canadian home
to die among his kinsmen. There in the
long days of pain and waiting the seed scattered
in the meetings began to spring and
come to full fruitage, for the dying man
passed over the river lighted by the presence
of one who said, "I am the light of the
world."</p>

<p>While the Sky Pilot preached in a certain
camp there was a wondrous quiet, for
the Spirit of God brooded above the place,
and his presence always brings life. No one
was surprised when a woodsman walked up
to the preacher and said, "Mr. Higgins, I
want you to pray for me right now."</p>

<p>The sermon closed without another word
and prayer was offered for the desiring man
who had boldly taken a stand for righteousness.
When the minister had closed his
prayer the man said, "I want to pray for myself,"
and in presence of the watching camp
the man made his petition for pardon and
received it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
Turning to his workmates he told them
that this was the end of his old life and its
works and that in the future he would work
for Christ as well as trust him.</p>

<p>After supper was over the next evening
the men of the camp received a new idea of
Christian service. The convert of the previous
night took out his violin and began to
play the favorite of the camps&mdash;"Jesus
Lover of My Soul." The lumberjacks listened
and their interest turned to astonishment
when the convert drew out a Bible and
began to read a chapter to the crowd. But
if they were astonished at the reading they
were dumbfounded when he announced that
he was going to give them a talk. He had
learned the principles of scripture in his
youth and now he gave the boys the old gospel
which was doubly precious to him because
of his recent experience.</p>

<p>Through the winter he continued to hold
meetings with the men, and in all the north
woods there was no prouder camp, for it
claimed to be the only one having a settled
pastor. When Mr. Higgins returned
to the camp he found the men happy in the
new condition, stimulated with the encouragement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
the convert had given them and
more ready to learn of the transforming
power of the Divine Man of Galilee.</p>

<p>"The woods were God's first temples," and
in the green solitudes, under the unchanging
pines, men are worshiping.</p>

<span class="subhead">ITINERATING IN THE CAMPS.</span></h2>

<p>In all parts of northern Minnesota are
found the logging camps. The distances
traversed by the missionaries in reaching
these outposts demand determined purpose,
strength of body and love for humanity.
The lumberjacks that are in a camp this
winter are scattered all through the north
with the opening of the next logging season,
for there is little to tie a man to one
employer in preference to another, and those
who received the services of the mission
workers one year are ever ready to claim
them in their new place of labor. The result
of this scattering is that requests come to
Mr. Higgins from all parts of the lumber
district, asking for the services of the missionaries.
The demand is greater than the
possibilities of the exchequer and many who
ask meet with disappointment. A mission
worker is placed over a group of camps,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
from eight to twenty, and from camp to
camp he goes with his tidings of salvation,
holding meetings every night in a different
camp. The work is strenuous, and he must
have a heart warm with the love for souls of
men who would willingly, faithfully brave
the dangers and privations consequent to
the long distances between the camps. It
would be hard to find a more devoted set
of men than these hardy camp preachers,
who set at naught the dangers that they may
serve God and assist their fellows.</p>

<p>Rev. Frank E. Higgins is superintendent
of the camp work and tries to reach every
camp in which any of his workers are laboring.
He is constantly on the go, "a sort of
walking boss for the Sky Route Co." The
scattered flock is loved by the shepherd and
he will brave any danger to serve the people
he has chosen to reach.</p>

<p>Minnesota's winters are severe. It seldom
thaws after November and the thermometer
often registers thirty degrees below zero,
not seldom reaching a much lower mark.
If a strong wind is blowing when the temperature
is low the cold penetrates even the
warmest furs and pierces the wayfarer with
its keen arctic shafts.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img id="if_illo_141" src="images/illo_141.jpg" width="600" height="345" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption">TOTING WITH FLASH</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
Beautiful is the deep mantle of pinery
snow. No soot or stain is on the bosom of
the earth, only the long stretch of "the white
silence." But too often the work of the missionaries
is increased by the heavy snows,
and the delight of the forest is lost in the
heart-breaking labor of the journeys from
camp to camp. Put your "turkey" on your
back and try the trudge through the deep
snows, and see if the romance does not depart
as weariness enters the limbs. Step
forward in the early morning through the
new fallen snow. The north wind is visiting
the earth, and his breath is penetrating
even the furry clothing. Go on! The camp
that ends the journey is only the little distance
of ten long, lonely, humanless miles.
The pack may be heavy when you start, but
before long you are transporting a mountain
that has developed from a peak to an
endless range of Himalayas. The fun has
departed and only the hard spirit of fatigue
is your company. Every step is an effort,
every blast of the wind reaches the marrow:
the exposed face feels like cold onyx, and
the wind-inflamed eyes look through frozen
lashes for the smoke of the cookshed above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
the distant trees. The fingertips send to the
brain their protest against the numbing cold
that stiffens them, and the arms are swinging
to aid the frozen blood to reach the
pained extremities. Mile after mile, endlessly
the trail stretches into the forest;
mile after mile the pain and suffering continue;
mile after mile the weary feet drag
the heavy burden to carry the message of a
Savior to the neglected men who, far from
civilization, work in the pine forests of the
North Star State. At last, yonder above the
green sea of Norway lances, the column of
smoke rises like a beacon to tell of warmth
and food, and the safe companionship of
men. The sight of the unconscious smoke
acts like a stimulant. At last the view of
the crude camp breaks in fulness on your
eyes. Moses saw the Promised Land from a
distance, but the sight of that collection of
log shacks means more to you, tired and almost
frozen, than the land beyond muddy
Jordan did to the writer of the Pentateuch.
It means a chance to rest, to warm&mdash;and to
the missionary, who is daily making this
journey through the frozen forest, a chance
to preach the unsearchable riches of the
world's Savior.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
Night after night the missionary holds his
meetings, each night in a different camp.
The day is spent in passing from one camp
to another, for often the camps are far apart
and transportation is primitive; it depends
on first principles.</p>

<p>During the first three years of Mr. Higgins'
work he found that while a man could
do much, a man and two dogs could do
more. He secured two large St. Bernard
dogs and by means of his dog team made
the long journey between the camps. The
idea of using a dog team is a very practical
one. It furnished an easy means of locomotion,
the task of stabling was not difficult
and the cost of food nothing. When
the run was to be made between points on
the railway the dogs and sled could easily be
placed in the baggage car and be ready for
the drive to the camp as soon as the train
stopped.</p>

<p>In all new work prejudice must be met,
and in this respect the mission to the camps
was no exception. Some thought it a new
species of graft, others desired to be left to
the old ways and many had a prejudice due
to another form of religion. It is not often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
that dogs assist in breaking religious prejudices,
but Flash and Spark had a large part
in assisting the logging camp mission into
easy paths. The lumberjacks are passionately
fond of animals, and the advent of the
dog team made a favorable first impression
in almost every camp. The doors of many
bunkhouses are secured by a sliding latch,
and when pressure is brought to bear against
the outside of the door it will open without
the raising of the latch. On arriving at
the camp in the evening the missionary
would drive his team against the door and
right into the bunkhouse. The sudden, unexpected
arrival immediately created interest,
and while the men crowded around the
handsome dogs the minister would explain
his business and announce the time of meeting.
The dogs were protectors as well as
workers and at the beginning of this work
the faithful animals silenced many a menace.</p>

<p>The dogs were good travelers. Over the
rough forest trails they would drag their
sled at the rate of six or eight miles an hour
and be none the worse for thirty or forty
miles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
On a journey from Northome to International
Falls, Minnesota, the Sky Pilot
lost his way on the Little Fork River. When
night came on and it was evident that no
sheltered lodging could be found the minister
and his dogs prepared to camp under the
zero sky. A large fire was built around a
pine stump and wood collected for the
night. The only food Mr. Higgins had with
him was a rabbit he had shot, and this was
divided between himself and the dogs. It
was the only food since breakfast. The
sweet green boughs of the pines furnished
a bed above the snow and the robes from the
sled gave a degree of comfort to the resting
place, whose canopy was the frozen
dome of heaven. By his side the dogs
pressed closely for the warmth. The dark
depths of night hung like a spangled sheet
above, but nearer than the shades which
surrounded the sleeper was the One who
never slumbereth.</p>

<p>During the night the howling of the timber
wolves awakened the missionary and in
the dark circle around him he could see
the fireballs of their eyes, while their voices
were distinct and near. Arising, the missionary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
replenished the fire, and when it
broke into a cheery blaze the howling of the
disappointed wolves grew fainter until the
silence of the forest again took up its interrupted
reign.</p>

<p>Early the next morning the minister was
on his way and soon arrived at the village
of Little Forks, where he conducted the first
religious service ever held in that place.</p>

<p>On another occasion, when passing from
one distant camp to another, Mr. Higgins
was overtaken by a severe snowstorm and in
a few minutes all sense of direction was lost
in the raging blizzard. The dog team wandered
from the beaten path into the muskeg
and in the swamp they were compelled to
spend most of the day. Toward evening the
worst of the blizzard had passed and he was
able to complete his long and weary journey.</p>

<p>After supper Mr. Higgins went to the
barn to feed his dog team, but to his astonishment
the dogs refused all food. He had
driven them hard and long, so when they
refused to eat he naturally thought it was
due to overwork and reproached himself for
being thoughtless of his friends. Later he
went to them again, but they would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
touch a morsel of food. With a sore heart
the preacher retired to his bed, but his rest
was disturbed with dreams of the overdriven
dogs. He arose early, and when going
towards the barn met the proprietor,
whose face was red with anger.</p>

<p>"Is them blank dogs yours?" asked the
angry man.</p>

<p>"They are," said the missionary, wondering
if the man was going to add to the
reproach by telling him that the dogs were
dead.</p>

<p>"Then pay for the pork that the brutes
chewed up while you were at supper last
night. The hungry cannibals swiped half
a hog and ate it. I ain't got nothin' but
eggs and salt meat to give the boarders today."</p>

<p>While the enraged hotel keeper was narrating
his tale of woe a load of anxiety
passed from the preacher's mind and before,
the proprietor had finished he found his
auditor laughing with hearty spirit. Mr.
Higgins paid for the meal of the "hungry
cannibals," but he remarked in telling it:</p>

<p>"I did not object, for it was the only time
I was ever asked to pay their board, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
assure you they earned it while we were
trying to find our way in the blizzard."</p>

<p>Snow storms come up suddenly, and when
the wind whirls the sheet of fallen flakes,
all points of the compass are soon lost even
to the well tried woodsman. The description
of a blizzard may form an interesting
page in fiction, but the experience adds to
gray hairs and unending memory.</p>

<p>In January, 1906, Rev. Frank Higgins
was crossing Red Lake, when the snow began
to fall. The uninterrupted wind, as it
swept down the long stretch of ice, caught
the loose snow and filled the air with its
choking mass. The wooded shore was soon
hidden by the veiling snow and all sense of
direction had disappeared. Down the
twenty miles of the lake the crystal clouds
swept with increasing volume. Night was
coming on, and yet the darkness could
scarcely add to the helplessness of the wanderers.</p>

<p>To the Father, who ruleth the rain of
summer and the snow of winter, the missionary
raised his prayer for help, and what
man could not do was done by the leading
of the ever-helpful God. He who guideth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
the stars in their courses led the lost to the
wooded shore.</p>

<p>On the shore not a human habitation
was to be seen, neither did the minister
know the direction to the nearest village.
For several hours he wandered in the unbroken
forest, and near the low hour of
midnight he came to the miserable shack
of an Indian squaw. His scanty knowledge
of the Indian tongue came into happy use
and the lonely inhabitant granted him permission
to sleep on the floor until morning
came and the blizzard had spent itself.</p>

<p>When the Camp Mission first began to
distribute literature, it caused a change in
the means of transportation, for there were
heavy boxes of old magazines to carry to
the camps and horses were needed to haul
the loads. Mr. Higgins had noticed that
there was little to amuse the men of the
camps and nothing helpful for their leisure
hours. He therefore wrote to the churches
in the state asking them to collect old magazines
and ship them to him for distribution.
The churches responded and soon he
and his helpers were distributing literature
to about one hundred camps. From five to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
seven tons of magazines are distributed in a
season. Great good has come from this
feature of the work; it gave the mind another
channel for vent, the filthy conversation
so common in the camps has largely
passed away, and through reading the men
are less inclined to quarrels. It has been
noticed by the logging contractors that even
the illiterate find recreation in the illustrations
and many a dark hour has been
brightened to the men who never read a
line.</p>

<p>On going into a camp which he was visiting
for the first time, Mr. Higgins held his
service and afterwards distributed his magazines.
Immediately there was a rush for
the reading matter and then for the wannigan
to buy lanterns by which to read. In
a few minutes the clerk had sold every lantern
he had in stock and could have disposed
of several more, had they been on
hand.</p>

<p>"What are you doing?" asked the cranky
clerk when the Sky Pilot entered the office
a little later. "Are you trying to turn the
bunkshack into a night school? I've sold
every lantern in the place and the Jacks
are crying like fiends for more."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
"I've only distributed a few magazines so
the boys can read a little improving matter,"
said the minister.</p>

<p>"Lumberjacks improving their minds?"
sarcastically replied "the guy that splashes
ink." "This neck of the woods will have a
university extension course next, if this
thing keeps up."</p>

<p>"You surely don't object to the boys reading?"
asked the minister.</p>

<p>"Not at all," said the clerk sulkily, "but
you might have remembered that a clerk
has lots of time to read and have left a few
of your mind-improvers for his use also."</p>

<p>The clerk received his share of the reading
matter before the Pilot left the camp.</p>

<p>Often when a box of magazines is brought
into the camp the men who have gone to
their bunks will arise and greedily come
forward to receive their share in the distribution.
These magazines are passed from
one to another until they are read and reread,
or worn out from much handling.
Of the lonely lives cheered by them, God
only could give the number.</p>

<p>In a warehouse in Akeley, Minnesota, a
bundle of magazines addressed to Rev.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
Frank E. Higgins was waiting for the tote-team
to carry it to a neighboring camp.
The tote-team driver came in, somewhat the
worse for the liquid refreshment he had
taken. While looking over the bundles
waiting for his load he espied the one addressed
to the Rev. Frank E. Higgins. The
bundle interested him and he read aloud:</p>

<p>"The Rev. Frank E. Higgins. Say, penpusher,
who is this for? Is it for our Frank
Higgins, the Sky Pilot?"</p>

<p>"That's the man," replied the clerk.</p>

<p>"The Rev. Frank E. Higgins," read again
the driver, "some mistake here, penpusher,
the Sky Pilot's no reverend, he's a Christian.
That man's no reverend, he's a Christian."</p>

<p>Shouldering the bundle he carried it to
the sleigh, still mumbling, "He's no reverend,
he's a Christian."</p>

<p>Pertaining to the use of the title "Sky
Pilot," a little story is told.</p>

<p>A minister who was going through the
camps investigating the work of the mission
referred to the various workers as "Sky
Pilot Davis," "Sky Pilot Date," and others.
He had heard the term used in reference to
Mr. Higgins and naturally assumed that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
was a title common to all the camp preachers.
The push in one of the camps heard
him, and turning to the clerk, asked:</p>

<p>"What the devil does he mean by Sky Piloting
around that way? You'd think the
woods were full of Sky Pilots, while we all
know there's only one, that's Higgins."</p>

<p>The tendency of the lumberjack is to
give the title to Mr. Higgins alone, although
it is occasionally given to the others, but
seldom by the old time lumberjacks. Higgins
alone is the Sky Pilot to them.</p>

<p>Among the rigid Catholics there is naturally
a prejudice against Protestant work, but
it seems that the work must be done by
Protestants or left undone. A priest could
hardly do the work. It would be difficult
to go through the forms and ceremonies of
Catholicism in the camps. Forms and
ceremonies are not successful when interruptions
are common and likely to occur at
any time.</p>

<p>But Mike Sullivan was no bigot. He
could appreciate the idea that all men were
striving to please God and hoping to reach
the same Heaven.</p>

<p>"This idea of having many churches
don't bother me any more," he said. "I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
think I get the idea. It's like this: these
camps around here's all working for one
company. O'Brien is push on section nine,
Johnson's boss at Camp 2 on fourteen, Kirk
is foreman on the north half of twenty-six
and White sees to the cuttin' on thirty-six,
while every gang is landing its stuff on the
same lake and in the spring they'll make
the drive together down the river. Gettin'
out logs is what they're paid for and the
lumber king in Minneapolis foots the bill
for the whole works. So what's the use of
jawin' if the push in our camp wears a different
kind o' shirt than the push on thirty-six.
Logs is what the man in Minneapolis
wants and he don't care how them different
foremen skids the logs so long as they get
the stuff to the landing. That's my way of
looking at the churches."</p>

<p>Now the work has proved itself, it is much
better understood and more highly appreciated
by men of all religious persuasions.
Many of the Catholics are deeply interested
in the progress of the work, for they know
that it does not strive to make Protestants
of them, but that its end and aim is to lead
the lumberjacks to a better life through the
simple presentation of Jesus Christ. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
result is that all classes and conditions crowd
into the place of meeting and give respectful
attention to the word of life.</p>

<p>One night at Stewart's camp, out from
Blackduck, Minnesota, the meeting was in
full swing when two teamsters entered the
bunkhouse and took their seats by the fire.
It was after eight o'clock, and they had just
returned from Blackduck where they had
been with their loads. On returning to the
camp they learned that the Sky Pilot was
holding service and came in supperless to
enjoy the meeting. Few of our towns people
would forego the pleasures of the table,
after the appetite had been sharpened by
hours of labor in the keen air of winter, in
order to attend a religious service. Such a
desire for the gospel on the part of the men
fills the missionary with a desire to impart
the truth. It is an inspiration to preach
to an eager audience.</p>

<p>The toil of the missionary increases with
each day. Exposure robs the body of its
vitality, the severe temperature and the
strong breath of the wind diminish the
powers of the men who must endure them,
be they ever so strong.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
The Sky Pilot had been hard at work for
several months and the arduous labor had
told on his unusual strength. He had taken
cold through exposure, but the work was
calling and he pushed on to the waiting
camps. It was storming and the pack he
was carrying grew heavier with every tired
step. He thought that the exercise of the
journey would in itself work a cure, but the
pain increased and the wretchedness was accentuated
by the cold. Drearily he plodded
on, hoping that some tote-team would come
that way and carry him to the camp, but no
welcome conveyance appeared. Unable to
proceed any further, he at last sat down in
the drifted snow to rest. Through the cut
over lands the cold wind swept its unobstructed
way, chilling the sick man to the
marrow. Off in the far north the tall Norways
lifted their long arms to heaven, while
the blasts of the wind waved them like the
grain fields of the treeless prairie. Miles to
the southward lay the habitations of men,
and yonder in the hiding groves to the north
was the camp he was hoping to reach. There
was warmth there, and to the sick man the
uninviting camp seemed a palace of comfort.
If he could only reach the shacks, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
he could reach the boys, that was all he
asked.</p>

<p>Gathering his remaining strength, he
struggled to his feet and pressed slowly
towards the goal. At last he entered the uncut
timber where the strength of the blast
was broken by the trees. On through the untrodden
snow he tramped, bent with weariness,
worn and pained, pressing on in spite
of illness until the smoke of the cookshed
showed itself above the hollow in which the
buildings were located. There the lumberjacks
found him and assisted him to the
shelter of the camp, where they tenderly
worked to warm and comfort the man who
had so often stood between them and death.
Everything that they could do for the missionary
was gladly done, but they were limited
by isolation and the minister was very
sick. After supper the men in the bunkhouse
discussed the situation:</p>

<p>"The Sky Pilot's a pretty sick man," said
the bull cook, "and we ought to do something
to help the poor devil." This was
rough but affectionate.</p>

<p>"Whiskey's a good thing for one that's
ailin'," suggested one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
"Whiskey?" remarked another, "what's
the use of talking about whiskey in this
camp? You know that Sweeny's tongue
has been hanging out for a week and that's
proof there isn't a drop in the camp."</p>

<p>Various remedies were suggested but they
were not to be found. The men were discouraged
in their helplessness.</p>

<p>"We ought to do something for him," said
a Christian sawyer, "we can't give him any
medicine for we haven't it, but I'll tell you
boys, we can pray for the man that is always
praying for us."</p>

<p>The men were silent for a moment, then
a driver said, "I guess it's the only thing
we can do, but we've never logged much on
that land. You start the deal, Johnson, for
you're onto that game more than the rest
of the push. You say it aloud, Johnson,
and we'll sort of keep you company."</p>

<p>Reverently the men stood with bowed
heads while the Christian lumberjack led
in a rude prayer, and silently the men, who
prayed not for themselves, joined in the petition
for the man who "was always praying
for them."</p>

<p>That night when the missionary heard
of the praying lumberjacks he thanked God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
and wept himself to sleep. The morning
brought a brighter day to the men, for they
heard that their prayers had been answered,&mdash;the
Sky Pilot was on the way to recovery.</p>

<p>Whiskey, the Wheel and Women are the
Three Fates of the woodsmen. If the lumberjacks
could be separated from these the
chances for lifting them to a higher level
would be increased. Whiskey is the worst
of them and leads to the others. For self
protection the proprietors and contractors of
the camps are compelled to watch that no
liquor enters; with its introduction trouble
begins and a reduced output of logs is the
result. Yet in spite of the care exercised by
respectable foremen, it makes its way into
the camp, being carried by the tote-teams,
the bootlegger, and the men when returning
from the neighboring towns. Men with
strong appetites generally find a way to
satisfy their desires. The camp may be
miles from civilization, but the curse of
Olympic gods and depraved men makes its
way into the inaccessible places. Where a
camp is near a village alcohol is easy to obtain,
and Sunday, being a day of rest, is
likely to be a day of carousing and shame.</p>

<p>There were several camps near Island<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
Lake, and on the Sunday that Frank Higgins
visited the camps there the boys had
been "tanking up" with squirrel whiskey
from early morn. At the afternoon meeting
the spirit of whiskey showed itself in many
disturbances. One intoxicated man was
worse than the others and was finally thrown
out of the bunkhouse by the minister, and
after that things went smoothly.</p>

<p>Later in the day the missionary was in the
village of Island Lake and while talking to
a friend, the lumberjack he had ejected
from the camp came staggering up. The
campman was accompanied by a score of
his mates who were also under the influence
of liquor.</p>

<p>"Are you the blank preacher that fired me
out of the camp?" asked the man of the sudden
exit. There was passion in his tone and
he was evidently anxious for a row.</p>

<p>"I am the man," replied the brawny
preacher, drawing himself up and advancing
toward the lumberjack, "what have you
to say against it?"</p>

<p>The drunken man looked at the minister
as steadily as his unsteady legs would allow
him, and suddenly changed his mind about
the intended row.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img id="if_illo_163" src="images/illo_163.jpg" width="600" height="346" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption">THE SKY PILOT TAKING A MAN TO THE HOSPITAL</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
"Not a word, preacher, not a word. I ain't
got a word to say against it. Preacher, don't
you ever think I want to say anything
against it. I just wanted to know if you
was the man, that's all. You're all right,
preacher, you're all right. 'Twas a blank
good throw. I ain't got nothin' against it."</p>

<p>Turning to the other lumberjacks, Mr.
Higgins said:</p>

<p>"Boys, did you ever know Higgins to do
you a bad turn? Can you show me where I
have not tried to help you? Yet for the
sport of the thing you try to get this poor,
drunken fellow to cause trouble, just for a
moment's laughter. Is that a proper return?"</p>

<p>The men made no answer, but shame
rested on many a winter beaten cheek. That
night in a nearby camp almost every man
of them came to the preacher after the meeting.</p>

<p>"Forget it, Pilot," said the spokesman,
"We're ashamed of the way we came at you,
but you know it wasn't us, it was Whiskey.
That's your only enemy in these woods. Say
you'll forget it and shake."</p>

<p>"Thanks, boys, I have already. Give me
your hands."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
The pastorate has its trials, as every minister
knows, but for unbounded variety of
the unexpected the camp missionary has the
city man far in the rear. Church quarrels
have bounds, but where are the limits of the
quarrels of the lumberjacks? From words
they readily pass to blows and in a moment's
flight blood-shed results. In February of
this year the writer received a letter from
Mr. Higgins, describing a railway trip. A
portion is appended:</p>

<p>"I recently left Deer River on the Itasca
Logging Railroad for Fourtown, and experienced
the worst trip it was ever my lot to
take. The car was crowded with lumberjacks,
few of whom were sober. The woodsmen
had over twenty quarts of Deer River
squirrel whiskey, and in a short time things
were moving at a terrific rate. You may call
it a tempest in a teapot, but never have I
seen anything like the affair; no human
tongue could describe the sight. The Irish,
the Swedes and the Glengarry Scotch were
filled with whiskey, and every man was out
for blood, and blood they had,&mdash;an abundance
of it. An old time lumberjack said
that in all his days in the woods he has yet
to see the equal of the scene.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
"I took a hand in trying to keep the boys
in order and although I succeeded in preventing
three fights, the conditions were
soon beyond me, for it was impossible, even
for a traveling missionary, to be in more
than one part of the car at the same time
and the performance was more than a three
ring affair.</p>

<p>"When matters got to this pace I had to
content myself with taking a hand only
when it seemed that permanent injury would
be done to the participants. One old man,
very much under the influence of liquor,
had his face battered beyond recognition. I
pulled off the chastiser, but did not succeed
in releasing the old man before one of his
eyes had been closed and the mouth and face
were covered with blood. No sooner had the
champion of this affair been separated from
the old man than another lumberjack was
at the bully and the bully was taking the
same medicine he had so liberally given to
the old fellow. This second scrap placed
another patient on my hands.</p>

<p>"When we came to the different camps
and the men began to get off the train, I
had to literally drag them through the snow
away from the track, so they would not be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
killed, for many of them were too drunk and
excited to realize the danger.</p>

<p>"I hope I shall never see such a condition
again. Was it not Paul who said, 'I have
fought with beasts at Ephesus.' I had a like
experience on that logging train. A sober
woodsman who saw the fight of the
drunken lumberjacks said, 'Pilot, why do
you continue to work among such men?'
and I made answer, 'Because my Master died
to save such.' This is to me a sufficient answer.
The conditions need changing, and
the only thing that will bring about a
change is the Gospel."</p>

<p>In the sleigh of the Sky Pilot antiseptic
bandages and a few medicines are carried.
Through them he is able to relieve the
wounded and assist the sick. His sleigh is
often converted into an ambulance and men
who have met with accidents are carried to
the nearest hospital for treatment. If the accident
is severe he visits the wounded to give
cheer and hope. There, in the hospital, the
men have time to think of eternal things,
and the comfort of Christ is often the stimulus
of the recovering and the solace of the
dying.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
When death is approaching, the last letters
are written and assurance of decent interment
is given. The poor lumberjack
may have no money to meet the expense,
but the minister makes all arrangements for
the funeral and after the body is entombed
he goes back to the camp and tells the boys
of their comrade's request for Christian burial.
The campmen pay back every cent the
Sky Pilot has expended.</p>

<p>"Tell the boys that in this hour Jesus
Christ brought his strong salvation to me,"
said a dying man. "Ask them to trust him."</p>

<p>When the missionary goes back to the
camp with such a message from the dead
the interest is profound. Coming from one
of themselves it seems more real than if it
were the message of the preacher. When
the testimony comes from their own mates
they are more receptive to the gentle Gospel
of the Cross. Often in death a lumberjack,
by his message to the foresters, has accomplished
more than in his years of life.</p>

<p>While speaking of this itinerating work we
must add a paragraph concerning the homesteaders.
In this forest region is much land
that is open to settlement. The little cabins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
of the homesteaders, who have taken up
claims, are seen in many parts of the forest,
and the small clearings tell of man's presence.
When the settlers hear that Rev.
Frank E. Higgins is to hold services in a
neighboring camp they are often found at
the bunkhouse meetings. Mr. Higgins is
practically the only pastor who visits the
scattered peasantry; he conducts their marriage
ceremonies, baptizes their children and
speaks the last words over their dead. Into
these homes he alone comes bearing spiritual
tidings. Some of these homesteaders work
their farms in summer and in the winter
help out the scanty increase of the little
fields by working in the logging camps. So
in passing the new homes he leaves the literature,
"speaks a good word for Jesus
Christ," adds a sentence of comfort and
passes along the trail,&mdash;like a true servant
of him who was gladly received by the common
people because he went about doing
good. "Go ye into the highways and hedges,"
said the Nazarene.</p>

<h2 class="vspace"><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a><br />

<span class="subhead">WORK IN THE LUMBER TOWNS.</span></h2>

<p>In the camps the missionary is largely a
preacher; in the lumber towns the work
he must do is cut to no design or pattern.
One might call it pastoral work, and in a
free use of the term it is, but I know of no
pastor who is doing work of this nature unless
it be the men in the city missions. It is
work which consists largely of the unexpected&mdash;changing
a chance circumstance into
Christian activity.</p>

<p>The villages and towns have followed the
railways, bringing in the many alluring
vices of civilization. Through the approaches
of vice the campmen have been demoralized,
their lives made almost worthless, and their
characters seared with the brand of iniquity.
The contractors find it a task to obtain suitable
men for their crews, for the saloon and
its concomitant evils have made many of
the lumberjacks irresponsible and incapable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
The men will leave their work on the least
provocation to spend a few days in debauchery.
Often a contractor finds himself, in
the parlance of the camps, "with one crew
coming to camp, another working, and another
leaving camp." This means loss on
the part of the men and inability on the
part of the contractor to deliver his contract
of logs. As one contractor expressed it: "The
jacks work until their hides begin to crack,
then follow their tongues to the nearest irrigation
plant, tank up until the stake is
blown, then mosey to a camp to dry out
again." The village and town saloons are
largely the cause of this. The rum shops,
and worse, are ever on the lookout for the
boys, and he who escapes the clutches of the
godless crowd must indeed be immune to
temptation.</p>

<p>Mr. Higgins was in a hotel in Tenstrike,
Minnesota, when a lumberjack who had finished
his winter's work came into the house
to wait for the train going south. Immediately
the saloon men and gamblers were after
him but he resisted and left the village with
his check uncashed. The gamblers learned
that he was going to Bemidji so they wired
to the gamblers of that place to meet him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
When the woodsman left the train he was
hailed by a waiting "toot." The "toot" was
genial, gracious, sympathetic, and to cement
the friendship, the one must treat and the
other do likewise. While they drank the attendant
at the wheel made music with the
roulette ball and soon in response to the
siren's singing the lumberjack was seated at
the wheel where he lost in a few hours the
wages it had taken him months to earn.
When he left the place he was drunken, penniless,
forsaken.</p>

<p>The writer and Frank Higgins were going
through a gambling den in one of the northern
towns. At the roulette wheel sat a young
traveling man playing his chips with liberal
hand. Merrily the ivory rattled in the
groove and settled in the space. Now he
lost, now he won. Joy or anguish was on
his face as he played to increase his winnings
or retrieve his losses. It was interesting
to watch the play of the man's passions
as expressed in his countenance. Hour after
hour the game dragged on. We visited other
resorts of the lumberjack and returned at
midnight, but the traveling man was still
at the wheel. Hope still lingered, but from
the haggard, drawn expression of his face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
we could tell that he had lost heavily. It
was 1:30 A.&nbsp;M., when the game ended and
the man was without a cent. Mr. Higgins
spoke to him in the lobby of the hotel. Despair
was depicted on the man's face. Worn
with anxiety, he staggered like one under
the power of liquor, although not a drop
had passed his lips, and the wild look of his
eyes suggested the haunted mien of one who
might attempt his own life.</p>

<p>When Mr. Higgins spoke to him, he replied:</p>

<p>"I am an embezzler tonight. I have spent
all my own money and all the money with
which my employer had trusted me. I deserve
the penitentiary."</p>

<p>Continuing, he told us his story. He
was trained to a profession but the confinement
of his vocation brought on ill health
and he had begun to travel for a well known
firm. He was the only child of respectable
parents, and in his present wretchedness he
thought of the disappointment and grief
coming to these aged ones as a result of his
folly. I could not but admire the handsome
fellow, foolish though he was, for his apparent
love for his home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
"I have disgraced them," he said in anguish,
"and when they hear of my dishonesty
it will kill them."</p>

<p>He went to the desk and wrote a letter to
the firm telling them of his fall and how he
had lost their money in gambling. When he
was about to mail the letter Mr. Higgins
went to him again and tried to induce him
to go to bed.</p>

<p>"No," he said, "I could not sleep, and if I
could, I have no money to pay for a room.
I have been dishonest enough already without
wronging the proprietor."</p>

<p>"Clerk, give him a room and charge it to
me," said Mr. Higgins, taking the matter
into his own hands. "Now, brother, you go
to bed and stay there until I call you, and
we'll see what we can do. Don't mail that
letter. Perhaps it won't be necessary in the
morning."</p>

<p>He went to breakfast with us. After the
meal the missionary went out to interview
the town and county officials. The result of
the conference was that the gambler turned
over to the traveling man the amount of
money embezzled and took his note for the
same. The traveling man pledged his word
never to gamble again and went on his way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
sadder, and we hope wiser, because of the
experience.</p>

<p>The same night on which the above incident
occurred, we entered a palatial saloon
and gambling place and found but few
men present, for it was a season when most
of the men were in camp after spending the
Christmas holidays in town. We entered
into conversation with the proprietor of the
place.</p>

<p>"Things are pretty quiet," said Mr. Higgins,
"I suppose you are not making expenses
just now?"</p>

<p>"Hardly," answered the proprietor, "but
I needn't worry, it will come in later." He
nodded to the camps west of town, "All the
boys are working."</p>

<p>This is the attitude of these keepers. They
consider the earnings of the lumberjack as
their legitimate spoil and part of their yearly
income.</p>

<p>The wife of one of the saloon proprietors,
overhearing a remark concerning her jewels
and apparel, said:</p>

<p>"I can afford to wear rich clothing. My
husband has about a thousand men working
for him in the woods." The meaning was
obvious: that these men would spend their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
earnings in the saloon, at the gaming table,
and in the retreats connected with her husband's
establishment.</p>

<p>The brazen effrontery of those engaged in
this business is indescribable. The flesh and
blood of men is to be lowered to the level of
the brutes, appetites of lust are to be satisfied,
passions of evil are to be encouraged,
and no shade of shame is to be found on the
countenances of this depraving element.
Where money is to be had the souls of men
are not to be considered. Human misery is
nothing. There is money in the damning
business&mdash;then damn the soul and get the
money is the policy.</p>

<p>An extensive self-satisfaction, a mantle of
self-righteousness, clothes the men of this vocation.</p>

<p>"Bad? Of course it's a bad business," said
one, "but if we don't sell the stuff some one
else will. As long as there are fools to buy it
we intend to supply them. It's their lookout,
not ours."</p>

<p>"But don't you think you are morally responsible
for tempting men?" I asked.</p>

<p>"All a man is responsible for is being honest,"
he replied. "I have been honest in all
I have done. No man was ever robbed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
my place, and the games are straight. I
may go to hell when I am through here, but
my job will be shoveling coal to make it hotter
for the hypocrites who profess to be honest
and then steal when they get the chance."</p>

<p>They talked freely of their business and
one gambler had the courage to make this
assertion:</p>

<p>"There isn't a more honest set of men in
the country than the professional gamblers.
They are all right, but the associations are
bad."</p>

<p>The above may be a description of some
gamblers, but not of all, for it is well known
that the games are often crooked and by
mechanical devices are made a sure thing for
the house.</p>

<p>In one of the range towns a cruiser entered
a gambler's place with several thousand
dollars in his possession. It was not
long before he had lost all. Satisfying himself
that the game was not "on the square,"
he drew his gun and shot up both the gambler
and the wheel, took his money from the
till and left the place. The gambler was
maimed for life.</p>

<p>The saloons and gambling places are palatial
and attractive. They are fitted with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
the best the town affords, resplendent with
glitter and flash of lights, showy woodwork
and decorated walls. Courtesy and attention
await the victims, for an army of
men is ready to respond to any desire
the lumberjacks may express, no matter how
low. Everything is designed to allure. No
wonder the men who have known only the
discomforts of the camps, with their hard,
grinding labor and unaesthetic surroundings,
are easily caught in the net that is
spread at their feet.</p>

<p>Because of this lawless element so common
in the lumber towns, and the unrestrained
ways in which almost all of the
towns are run, the "open" policy being the
common one, there is work for the camp
missionary to do. The Rev. Frank Higgins
goes into the saloons to find the stray sheep.
His errands of mercy have led him into
hundreds of dram shops and gambling
places.</p>

<p>The writer was with him in one of the
towns and the following incidents are only
a part of that day's work of helpfulness:</p>

<p>Having heard from a contractor that one
of the boys had been reduced to helplessness
through drink, and more than drink, Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
Higgins started for the saloons and continued
his search through many groggeries until
at last he found the man. The poor
drunken wretch was lying on the floor behind
the stove, and the missionary put his
strong arms around the besotted being and
almost carried him to a lodging place where
his needs were supplied.</p>

<p>After that we visited the hospital to call
on the camp boys. There he heard of a
lumberjack who had been dismissed from
the hospital that morning. The man was
able to be around but too weak to work, and
was penniless. So the second search began
and the man was located in the lobby of a
cheap hotel. Mr. Higgins went to the proprietor,
guaranteed him against loss, and
went on his way leaving the lumberjack free
from care while regaining his strength. The
man had been converted in the camps that
winter, but so miserable had been his morals
that no one trusted him. That was two years
ago; today he is a respected Christian
worker.</p>

<p>Later came the assisting of another helpless
lumberjack and the day closed with the
incident of the gambling traveling man, described
in this chapter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
It is helpfulness that counts. On the
banks of the Galilean lake our Master, who
never wearied of doing good, met his disciple
Peter and said unto him, "Simon, lovest
thou me?"</p>

<p>Peter replied to the question, "Yea, Lord,
thou knowest that I love thee." Then the
divine lips opened and gave to Peter and to
us the end and aim of the Christian's relation
to man&mdash;"Feed my sheep." If we love
our Master, Christian activity in the form of
assisting men should be an ever-present result.</p>

<p>In instances like the following the flesh
may rebel, but the command still remains:</p>

<p>For three weeks Mike had been on a
drunken spree; during the days and nights
of debauchery he had not changed his
clothes or even washed his hands. This was
his condition when Mr. Higgins found him
senseless with drink in the "snake room."
The missionary took him to a lodging house
and bathed the body from which the cleansing
water had so long been absent. The
man's feet were so swollen that the heavy
boots were removed with difficulty and
when the socks were taken off the skin came
with them. It was no wonder that the effluvium<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
drove the minister from the room. It
was a hard task, against which the flesh rebelled,
but the Master gave the command,
"Feed my sheep," and here was one who
needed attention. Tenderly the Sky Pilot
watched over the poor fellow, supplying his
needs until a few days later he was able to
return to the camp. The man thus helped
had been educated for the Catholic priesthood
and drink had ruined him.</p>

<p>Actions such as these may not result in
the great end of conversion, but they do result
in aiding the cause of Christ, for the
men see in the missionary the spirit of the
helpful Master.</p>

<p>Many times during the period of Mr. Higgins'
residence at Bemidji, Mrs. Higgins was
awakened at night by some poor, spent lumberjack
who came to the Sky Pilot's home to
ask for assistance. Although she was alone,
Mr. Higgins being in the camps, she would
arise and feed the hungry man and then
direct him to some place where he could
spend the night.</p>

<p>"Who is that man?" asked a stranger who
had been watching Mr. Higgins as he went
among the lumberjacks in the village
street.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img id="if_illo_185" src="images/illo_185.jpg" width="600" height="395" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption">LOADING FROM A LAKE</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
"That's the Lumberjack Sky Pilot, a fellow
who never turned a lumberjack down,"
said the woodsman, and added, "His job is
keeping us out of hell." It was crudely expressed,
but it represents the sentiment of
the boys; with them Christianity must act
as well as speak.</p>

<p>When a lumberjack is in trouble with the
police he is quite sure to send for Mr. Higgins
if the Sky Pilot happens to be in the
village. Mr. Higgins is well known in these
communities and the officials respect him for
the interest he shows in his wayward flock.
Many a poor fellow, who awakens from a
drunken sleep to find himself in the lockup,
wonders if the Sky Pilot is near. The missionary
has often pleaded for a light sentence
or asked for the case to be annulled.</p>

<p>On one occasion he had been called to the
justice court to plead for a woodsman who
was charged with being drunk and disorderly.
The preacher asked the justice to
make the sentence as light as possible and to
allow the man to go after giving him a reprimand.
The judge was an old friend of the
missionary, and at the time of the trial could
hardly be called sober. Often he would appear
in his office the worse for liquor and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
dispense justice to the petty offenders. In
spite of his failing, the justice had a shrewd
sense of right and a great respect for the
dignity of his office.</p>

<p>After hearing the plea that Mr. Higgins
made for the lumberjack the judge decided
to reprimand the man and dismiss the case.
He tried to sober himself that the dignity
of the law might not suffer through the
weakness of the dispenser. He knew that
the office called for erect deportment, so the
bench straightened his figure and impressively
began the reprimand:</p>

<p>"W-whiskey is-s a bad thing. It ma-akes
a f-fool of an h-honest man and a d-d&mdash;n
f-fool of a f-fool. It s-shouldn't be used by
l-lumberjacks; t-they belong to the l-last
c-class already. It ma-akes a f-fool of every
man t-that touches it. If you don't believe
it, j-just l-look at the j-judge who has the
p-power of sentencing you. See w-what
w-whiskey has done for him. B-because of
my f-friend Higgins I'll let y-you off this
t-time, but remember the j-judge and let
w-whiskey alone. Dis-dismissed."</p>

<p>The example was a good one. Even Solomon
could not have chosen a more timely
illustration, for the judge vividly set forth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
in his own person what whiskey could do
for a man, and the woodsman appreciated
the force of the advice. Taking the missionary
with him, the lumberjack went to the
hotel and drew off his shoes. From the toes
of the shoes he extracted a roll of bills containing
one hundred and fifty dollars.</p>

<p>"If those blood suckers, who made me
drunk, had known I had this, they would
have robbed me of it the same as they did
of the rest and I wouldn't have a cent now.
Well, Pilot, I'm through with it. By God's
help, this is the last."</p>

<p>The man went to North Dakota and settled
on a farm. Today he is the proud
owner of three hundred and twenty acres,
and is prospering.</p>

<p>The writer is only trying to pen a brief
picture of the field as it presents itself to the
missionary. No man can give a full description
of the wide privilege that is open to the
minister in these places where the lumberjacks
congregate. He is required to perform
varying duties whether they are related to
the minister's calling or not. Often, in the
regular ministrations, elements are introduced
that suggest the burlesque rather than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
the solemn services common to the ministry,
as the following incident will illustrate:</p>

<p>It was the last day of the drive and the
riverpigs were coming into town after their
labors on the lakes and rivers. The town
was reaping its harvest&mdash;at least the saloons
and other evils were. As the Rev. Frank E.
Higgins walked the street, he was approached
by a drunken riverpig.</p>

<p>"Say, Pilot," he began, "one of our crew
fell off a log, pulled the hole in after him
and is at the coffin shop ready for the boneyard.
We uns want him planted like a decent
Christian; he wa'n't no squaw man or
Indian. See to the trimmings, will you?
Do the job up right if you have to buy out
every wannigan in town. Are you on, Pilot?
When you're ready call for us at Blank's
saloon, for we want to go with you to Jim's
bunking place."</p>

<p>The driver left him and entered Blank's
saloon to report progress to the boys and the
minister proceeded to the undertaker's establishment
to make the necessary arrangements
for the funeral. He ordered a plain
pine coffin, and after procuring a dray for a
hearse, drove up to Blank's saloon for the
boys.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
Out on the sidewalk the riverpigs came
noisily, but when they saw the dray with its
burden they stopped abruptly.</p>

<p>"It won't go, Pilot," said the one who had
made the arrangements. "This is no jack-pine
farmer's funeral; we're no cheap skates.
This camp's got money and intends to blow
it. See? Give us a run for our money."</p>

<p>Then another rum-soaked riverpig spoke
up: "If this was a tin-horn gambler or a
bloated saloon-keeper they'd have a hearse
and a brass band. Jim's only a riverpig, but
he's got to be planted with the frills just the
same."</p>

<p>"Get a decent box and hearse and call
again, Pilot," they shouted as they backed
into the saloon to "keep their hides from
cracking."</p>

<p>The funeral procession had a more imposing
appearance when it drew up a second
time at Blank's saloon. A hearse led the
procession and six carriages completed the
cortege. By this time the mourners were in
a state of intoxication, in which feelings of
the sublime and the ridiculous blend without
effort.</p>

<p>"This is the way to do it," cried one of the
riverpigs as he viewed the hearse and carriages.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
"Wouldn't Jim be tickled to death
if he saw this show and knew that he was the
whole blank thing?"</p>

<p>"Say, Pilot," said one whom Mr. Higgins
was helping into a carriage, "when we meet
Jim later he'll say, 'I'm proud of the way
you fellows rid me out of town.'"</p>

<p>"Pretty near two months' wages gone for
a box, but what's expense when we're planting
Jim," weepingly commented his bunkmate.
"He'd 'a done as much for me if I'd
'a give him a show. It's his last blow out
anyway."</p>

<p>All the way to the cemetery the mourners
talked in the above strain, constantly expressing
their satisfaction over the "frills"
of the obsequies and the "agony" they were
showing for Jim. There was an undertone
of complaint because poor drowned Jim did
not come forward and personally thank
them for the honor they had conferred.</p>

<p>Around the grave the riverpigs staggered
and it looked as if more than Jim were going
to occupy the grave, for with difficulty
they were kept from tumbling in on the
corpse. The minister spoke a few words on
the uncertainty of life and the need of preparation
for eternity, but his brief address<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
was interrupted by the weeping of the
drunken attendants and their interjected
praises of the dead.</p>

<p>"Speak a good word for Jim, Pilot," said
a weeping poleman. "Tell the Lord he
could ride a log as well as the best of us."</p>

<p>"Get him through if you can; he wasn't
so bad," was the parenthesis of a French-Canadian.</p>

<p>"Good bye, Jim. Our turn's comin'."</p>

<p>The last words were said, the benediction
pronounced, and the Sky Pilot turned
to leave the cemetery.</p>

<p>"Hold on, there," cried the foreman to
the minister. "This is no pauper you
buried, but a man whose friends ain't
broke."</p>

<p>Taking off his hat, he turned to the crew.
"Shell out, you blank sons of the nameless.
Jim's been planted O.&nbsp;K., now pay the Sky
Pilot for the words he shed over his bones.
This is no poor farm job."</p>

<p>The boys shelled out eight dollars and
sixty cents for the preacher's services.</p>

<p>The lumberjacks, the homesteaders, the
saloon men and the prostitutes claim the
missionary as their spiritual friend. It is on
him they call when sickness enters their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
places of abode, and his response is willing
and natural. He, as the servant of Christ,
is the messenger to the poor and outcast;
conditions of life are not considered.</p>

<p>One night, when the Pilot was in a brothel
praying with a woman who was passing
through the dark waters, the girls of the
house crowded around to listen to the
prayers and see the end. One of the girls
invited him to a private conversation and
in it told him the story of her life and the
nearness of her death. The physician had
informed her that six months was all she
could hope to live. "I'll make a short six
months of it, for this life is hell, and hell
can't be any worse than this," she said.</p>

<p>When the church service closed on the
following Sunday evening a messenger was
waiting at the Bemidji church to ask him to
come at once to the brothel. There he found
the girl with whom he had talked. She had
taken blue vitrol and this was the end. She
had been true to her statement and had
made a short six months of it.</p>

<p>The scarlet women turn to him naturally
for aid, for they know that he will do all he
can to assist in their reformation. His ready
sympathy appeals to the outcasts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
On a train leaving Blackduck the Sky
Pilot was sitting several seats from a woman
whose business was unmistakable. The car
was filled with men and the scarlet one was
known to many in the coach. As the train
started she beckoned to the preacher to come
and sit beside her. A smile passed over the
faces of the wise ones as the missionary took
a seat at her side.</p>

<p>But this is the woman's story: She had
recognized Mr. Higgins, having seen him
when he visited a woman who was dying in a
brothel. She was leaving the place of her
sin and degradation and did not know which
way to turn for help. Would he assist her?
She was tired of it all and wanted to live a
better life, but knew of no place that would
open except such as linked her to the old.</p>

<p>Mr. Higgins knew of a place where the
hands of Christians would welcome her and
the doors were always open&mdash;a Christian refuge
in the city of Duluth. Acting on his
advice, and assisted by a letter of introduction,
she went to the place and today leads a
respectable life under the influence of a
Savior. Did not the One of Nazareth say
unto such, "Go, and sin no more?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
Such is the condition that confronts the
missionary in the towns and villages near
the camps. You may ask, "Are not the
spoilers unfriendly, antagonistic to the missionary,
since they see that his work is in
opposition to theirs?" While they recognize
Mr. Higgins as against their nefarious traffic,
yet they admire his sincerity and honesty,
and prove their respect for him by calling
for his services in case of death. They know
that their business is under the ban, but they
also know that his Christian zeal causes him
to love the men while he is still an enemy
to the business. In one of the saloons where
the writer accompanied Frank Higgins, the
saloon man asked us to take a drink of seltzer
water.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't take even a drink of water in
one of your saloons," replied Mr. Higgins.
"You know I am against your whole business."</p>

<p>"We know it," returned the saloon man,
"but while you fight us, you do it fair, and
although you hurt us, we like you in spite
of it."</p>

<p>So without enemies, even among his opponents,
he goes from place to place, helping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
pointing to Christ the lumberjacks, the saloon
men, the gamblers and the prostitutes,
doing a work few are fitted to do.</p>

<p>The logging camp mission work must of
necessity be a disconnected one, and the missionary
often does not see the final results of
his labors as in a settled pastorate, but the
churches reap the benefit of what is accomplished
in the camps. Many are brought to
Christ who would never have been touched
by his saving power if it had not been for
the itinerating work of the pineries. The
church has too long neglected this large
field. Now she is attempting to redeem the
time, but the present effort is a small supply
for such a large demand.</p>

<p>What is being done to counteract the influence
that is thrown around the lumberjacks
in the towns? At present there is practically
nothing outside the two Bethels at
Duluth, to help them, with the exception
of a small effort in the way of reading
rooms, and I know of only two of these, one
in the town of Akeley, Minnesota, and the
other in Bemidji, Minnesota. About a year
ago Mrs. T.&nbsp;B. Walker and the M.&nbsp;E.
Church of Akeley opened a public reading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
room particularly for the mill hands and
employees of the Red River Lumber Company.
A little later Mrs. Thomas Shevlin
established the Crookston Lumber Company's
Club Room in the town of Bemidji.
Here the men can congregate and read the
papers and magazines provided. But these
are lonely exceptions of helpfulness.</p>

<p>The particular need of the lumbertown is
a well-equipped, furnished and up-to-date
Bethel, for at present the only places open
to the lumberjacks are degrading&mdash;tending
to produce poverty of soul and of purse. The
churches of these towns are not strong
enough to carry on the work unaided. If
the demands are to be met, outside help
must be extended. The churches are willing,
for the members see the need of Bethels,
but their own work calls for larger finances
than at present they are able to command.</p>

<p>If there is no place for him to enter except
the saloons, then of course we must expect
the lumberjack to go where he will find
a welcome. Open a place where he can find
rest apart from the tentacles of temptation
and we shall have done our part, and the
forester will do his. A Bethel will be to him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
a haven towards which his weary feet and
hungering social nature will turn with readiness,
and in many cases with more readiness
than they now turn to the saloons. All
men are social creatures; the lumberjack is
no exception. He wants to be where his fellows
are, to join in their conversations and
to take part in their interests, but the saloon
is the only place that furnishes a convenient
rallying point.</p>

<p>"I don't like the saloon, I don't care to
drink," said one, "but all the fellows who
are willing to talk to me are there and I
must go where they are." To meet the needs
of the homeless the Bethel must be substituted
for the saloon. Since something is
bound to grow, plant a virtue where you uproot
a vice.</p>

<p>The Bethel is not an untried theory, but
a proven success. Where these institutions
have been introduced they have been well
patronized and great good has been accomplished.
A gentleman of Duluth, Minnesota,
told of being on the bowery in that
city, and noticed a lumberjack looking at
every sign as he passed along. The man
wondered if he was having difficulty in finding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
a saloon where saloons were so numerous.
Suddenly the woodsman's face lighted
up as he came in sight of a building bearing
the sign of "Branch Bethel," and as he entered
he seemed to say, "Thank God, this is
for me. Here I shall find friends."</p>

<p>Once such rest places are opened they can
be made self-supporting, or very nearly so.
The lodging part of the plan would pay a
good return, an employment agency could
be carried on that, in itself, would be very
helpful both to the men and employers, and
add to the profits, while the missionary and
Christian woodsmen would advertise the effort
and largely add to its support. But
apart from this, the good they would accomplish
can only be appreciated by those who
know the present surroundings of the campmen
in town. When temptation is reduced
the increase in virtue is proportionate, where
the stimulus to righteousness is given men
must respond. To prevent evil is as much
a Christian work as saving the fallen, and
prevention would give less need for cure.</p>

<p>In the establishment of a system of Bethels
in the logging centers there is a fine
opening for Christian philanthropy. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
 men who have made their fortunes through
the labors of the woodsmen should be the
first to look to the uplifting of the fallen men
in their employ. In dollars and cents it
would pay the lumber kings, and many of
the difficulties now present in the employment
of men would be gradually reduced.
The lumbermen are becoming interested, but
it is a work that calls forth the interest of
every lover of humanity.</p>

<h2 class="vspace"><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a><br />

<span class="subhead">MUSCULAR CHRISTIANITY.</span></h2>

<p>Muscular Christianity has a rather far-off
sound in this matter-of-fact age where indifference
is present and many a church is under
the blight of apathy. But on the part
of the logging camp missionary there is no
apathy. His ministry is twofold: it is spiritual
and muscular.</p>

<p>Let some one who is more interested in
the dead past write the story of the rough
but earnest Crusaders, who fought in the
name of the gentle Christ with flesh-piercing
spear and blood-letting sword. That is a
tale, foreign, distant and past; the narrative
I bring is native, near and present. This
warfare is not with the weapons which are
the product of the fire and anvil, yet it is
muscular and strenuous; its purpose is not
death, but life, and its spirit is love. The
banner alone is the same&mdash;the Sign of the
Cross.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
Physical fitness of no common order is
required of the missionary of the forest. In
our northern pineries strength of limb, endurance
and hardiness are the necessary capital
of the workers. When the frolicsome
winds drive the mercury thirty or forty degrees
below zero and hold it in that low retreat
for days, the men who work under the
open sky must be vigorous to stand the
taunts of the north wind and strong to resist
the fettering cold. The pineries is no
place for weaklings, either as pastor or logger.
Brawn is an asset not despised, muscle
is honored, and endurance is the ideal of the
lumberjack.</p>

<p>The city pastor finds that head and heart
predominate in his work for souls; the missionary
of the logging camps soon realizes
that the first essential is bodily excellency&mdash;heart
and head are secondary in the estimation
of the woodsmen. They pity a weakling,
they respect a strong man. But to
strength must be added devotion if the man
who comes as Christ's messenger is to win.
They will willingly listen to the rough address
of a rough and ready man who can fell
a tree with precision and ease; the argument<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
of the man who is scientific of fist and nimble
of leg is sure of a ready reception.</p>

<p>It follows that the same kind of ministry
we look for in the city is not asked for in the
camps. The object of the work is the same&mdash;the
souls of men&mdash;but the methods and
means are more varied. The man of tact
soon sees that the body can be used to do a
glorious work for the King, and that he who
is fearful of manual exercise cannot be a
winning ambassador for his Master.</p>

<p>Physical Christianity sounds like a story
of the middle ages, but this form of godliness
is being used successfully to point men
to Christ in the great north woods. It is not
forcing men to accept his teaching, but doing
with physical might for him whatever
the hands find to do.</p>

<p>Of more value than discussion will be the
narrative, and so I present to the reader a
few plain tales of the lights and shadows,
the labors and losses in the life of the missionary
who spends his all for the men who
are far from civilization, far from Christ,
lonely, wayward, rough, but still our brothers
for whom our Master died.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
The village was little more than a collection
of rude shacks. In its confines two hundred
people made their homes. Even in the
logging district one would search long for a
place more under the influence of open sin.
The camps were near and the village traffic
was evil&mdash;almost exclusively evil. Nine saloons
were the ornaments of the place and
the large brothel occupied a prominent place
in the social life. There was little in the
village to commend, much to condemn. Its
influence was vicious and its efforts were to
impoverish the campmen.</p>

<p>It was nearing the spring of 1905. The
camps would soon break up for the winter,
and the Rev. Frank E. Higgins, while making
his rounds, found himself, after nightfall,
in the village described above. The
lunchroom was in the rear of a saloon and
there the missionary took his belated meal.
Many drinking lumberjacks were at the bar
and soon they crowded around the minister
with invitations to drink with them.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what I'll do, boys; if my dog
will drink the stuff you fellows are imbibing
I'll drink with you," said Mr. Higgins.</p>

<p>He called his dog to him, and at his command<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
Bess placed her front feet on the bar,
but on smelling the beverage turned away.</p>

<p>"Can't do it, boys; I'd hate to set a bad
example to my dog. You had better follow
her lead. She has good sense, as you all
know."</p>

<p>The men enjoyed the incident, and the
tired preacher went to his room. The sleeping
place was over the barroom, but in spite
of the carousing, he was soon asleep.</p>

<p>Shortly after midnight the minister was
awakened by a loud noise in the room below.
The sound of breaking glass and furniture,
the curses and cries of men rang loudly
through the house. A fight was in progress
and it was evident to the missionary that it
was more than a trivial affair. Hastily he
drew on some clothing and rushed down the
stairway which opened into the barroom.</p>

<p>In the middle of the saloon stood F&mdash;&mdash;, a
foreman from a nearby camp. He was
crazed with liquor and his powerful frame
shook with the excitement of the contest.
Over his head he held a heavy barroom
chair, and lying near him were three men
whom he had felled with the ready weapon.
The bartender had taken refuge under the
counter and outside of the open door were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
four lumberjacks who had fled into the cold,
but now inviting, street. F&mdash;&mdash; was in possession
of the field and the chair was both a
weapon and a banner of victory.</p>

<p>"Canada against the world! The Scotch
and nae ithers!" cried the drunken logger
in delight as he viewed the vanquished.</p>

<p>Rushing in, Mr. Higgins grabbed the foreman.
"F&mdash;&mdash;, think what you're doing, old
man. Do you want to kill some one?"</p>

<p>"A Hooligan struck me. Think of a Canadian
being struck by a Hooligan! Its
mair than flesh an' bluid can stan'," replied
the foreman as he menacingly moved in the
direction of the door where the enemy had
retreated.</p>

<p>"You can't afford to become a murderer
because a man lost his temper," said the
preacher. "Put down that chair and show
that you can control yourself, even if others
can't."</p>

<p>Placing the chair on the floor, F&mdash;&mdash;
watched Mr. Higgins assist the others to their
feet, but the men in the street did not venture
into the room until the preacher had
led F&mdash;&mdash; up stairs.</p>

<p>The Sky Pilot took the foreman to his
room, and when he saw him soundly sleeping,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
crept in beside him and soon was lost to
the day's tasks and disturbances. But the
missionary's sleep was not destined to be
undisturbed, for soon drunken oaths, the
shriek of a terrified woman and the heavy
blows of an ax falling on a door made the
preacher rush from his bed into the hall,
where he found the proprietor of the place
trying to break into his wife's room.</p>

<p>During the previous afternoon the proprietor's
wife had learned that her husband
was in a disreputable place and had gone to
the brothel to persuade him to accompany
her home. Her efforts were unavailing and
he remained there drinking and carousing
until midnight. When he returned home
under the influence of liquor, his offended
dignity sought retaliation in the murder of
his wife.</p>

<p>With the assistance of the bartender, who
by this time had gotten over his previous
fright, Mr. Higgins disarmed the drunken
proprietor and led him into another room,
where the missionary remained with him
until sleep held him fast.</p>

<p>The next day was the Sabbath. When
the missionary had finished his breakfast he
placed his phonograph on the table of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
roulette wheel and started "Rock of Ages."
The crowd of loungers had increased to a
considerable number by the time several selections
had been played, and when the song,
"Where Is My Wandering Boy Tonight,"
came to a close, it was in a receptive mood.
Portions of the Old Book were read and a
heart to heart talk followed.</p>

<p>The proprietor refused to serve any drinks
while this strange service was being held,
and at the close of the meeting he asked the
minister to remember him in prayer.</p>

<p>Shortly after the affair in the saloon the
Sky Pilot was in the camp where F&mdash;&mdash; was
foreman. It was the time when the annual
offering was to be given for the support of
the mission work. Mr. Higgins arrived at the
hour of the evening meal and learned that
the Sisters of Charity had been in the camp
at noon soliciting for the hospital work.
When the intelligence came to him he decided
to defer his request for an offering and
visit the camp a few days later.</p>

<p>After service Mr. Higgins said to the men:
"It was my intention to ask you to contribute
to this work tonight, but since the Sisters
have canvassed the camp today we will let it
go until my next visit."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
The preacher had scarcely finished the
announcement when F&mdash;&mdash;, the foreman,
sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>"Sit doon, Pilot," he said. "You dinna
need to ask ony collection in this shanty.
We ken a guid thing an' are willin' to pay
for't. I'll tak' up the collection, although
it's a new job to me. Shell oot, lads; remember
the Lord and F&mdash;&mdash; love a cheerfu'
giver."</p>

<p>When F&mdash;&mdash; had completed his self-imposed
task he handed the missionary forty-seven
dollars and fifty cents.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>There is persuasiveness in a well-rounded
muscular development. Some people are
impervious to argument and some to courtesy,
but few will fail to respond to the persuasiveness
of a strong man with a mighty
arm. Now I am not attempting to prove
that this is best, nor would I care even to
leave that intimation, but I remember the
days when the rod properly applied was far
more productive of good than all the homilies&mdash;in
fact, the homilies were heard only
because of the birch that, like Damocles'
sword, was ever waiting to fall. But this is
not autobiography.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
Some men remain children, and only the
potentials that produced results in childhood
will aid to fruitage in their manhood. Corporal
punishment was effective for good then,
and if you read the next incident you will
realize that it has its force after they have
passed through the vicissitudes of youth and
have attained the physical weight of manhood.</p>

<p>The bunkhouse meeting was in full
swing. The singing was hearty, strong and
free. When the lumberjacks wish to sing
they produce a volume that is inspiring in
spite of discords. Well, these men in Parker's
Camp felt the spirit of song&mdash;but not
all of them. An undertone of discontent
came from a group of Frenchmen who sat
together at the end of the shack. They did
not relish the Protestant religion and intended
to show their indigestion. The majority
of the camp was in harmony with the
preacher, but a small minority can easily
turn peace into turmoil.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img id="if_illo_217" src="images/illo_217.jpg" width="600" height="345" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption">A CAMP CREW</div></div>

<p>As the service progressed the opposition
grew louder and remarks came freely from
the French end of the house. Mr. Higgins
went to the disturbers while the rest were
singing and requested them to allow the others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
to enjoy the service. A second time the
preacher solicited their sympathy and all
went well until the address began. As the
missionary proceeded in his message the
rumble of the disturbers grew in volume until
the address could not be heard. Patience
was no longer a virtue, but an assistant to
evil. Rolling up his sleeves, for he was
preaching with his coat off, the minister left
his barrel pulpit and visited the Frenchmen,
not as an angel of mercy, but as a son of
Mars. Taking a position that could not be
misunderstood, he addressed them:</p>

<p>"You pea soup eaters will do one of two
things," said the brawny evangelist, "you
are going to listen to the gospel or take a
thrashing. Speak up, which do you want?"</p>

<p>"Throw them through the roof, Pilot,
we'll see fair play," cried a sympathizer.</p>

<p>"Take them one at a time, they won't last
long," came from another. "Give them both
the thrashing and the preaching," said the
swamper. "You've got to puncture the hide
of that outfit to get any decency into their
heads."</p>

<p>Then came a deep silence. Only the winter
wind outside and the roar of the stove
within were heard. During the quiet the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
Frenchmen carefully viewed this muscular
exponent of Christianity. On the preacher's
arms stood the muscles in rounded hills and
in his face was depicted determination and
fearlessness. The examination was satisfactory;
it was easy to decide in favor of a gospel
message under such circumstances. The
eyes of the Frenchmen dropped and the
preacher had won.</p>

<p>"I would rather preach anyway," said the
minister as he walked back to the barrel and
took up the interrupted discourse.</p>

<p>Among the firm friends of the Sky Pilot
that group of Frenchmen are now to be
found. The coatless figure, burning with
righteous indignation, powerful in right and
backed with physical prowess, won the admiration
of the disturbers. Conviction and
fearlessness always open a way for him who
is desirous of carrying the Cross. Even the
opponents learn the lesson of respect.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>On every fruit-bearing tree the worthless
fruit clings with the good and mellow.
Every effort is not a success, as all can testify.
Some seed falls by the wayside and is trodden
down. Again, the sower is not even allowed
to sow by the wayside. The devil is not dead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
and his agents are faithful to their commander.
As long as man is sinful, opposition
will show itself, but the darkness of
night makes the day more resplendent by
contrast.</p>

<p>In the month of January, 1906, our missionary
procured a letter of introduction
from the proprietor of a camp near Kelliher,
Minnesota to the foreman in charge. The
letter gave Mr. Higgins the privilege of holding
service in the bunkhouse. Armed with
this letter, and accompanied by Mr. F.&nbsp;E.
Davis, one of the camp workers, Mr. Higgins
entered the camp.</p>

<p>On arriving they went immediately to the
office and left their personal effects and a box
of literature, and then proceeded to find the
foreman in order to present their credentials.
Near the cookshed they came across a burly
Irishman who immediately bristled up and
without waiting for any greeting began:</p>

<p>"Are you Higgins?"</p>

<p>"I am," answered the missionary. "Is
this&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am G&mdash;," he interrupted.</p>

<p>"I was looking for you Mr. G&mdash;. I have a
letter of introduction from the proprietor,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
said the missionary, at the same time producing
the letter.</p>

<p>"I don't care a d&mdash;n if you have a letter
from God Almighty," profanely burst out
the push; "you can't preach in this camp.
Get your things out of the office blank quick
and get to Hades out of these works. I won't
have any blank preachers among my men."</p>

<p>Mr. Higgins looked at the profane man
and quietly answered: "I am in no haste
about leaving, Mr. G&mdash;, in fact this camp
has an added interest since I met you."</p>

<p>"Get out, or I'll throw you to Hades out
of here," said the wrathy foreman.</p>

<p>"Not so hasty, Mr. G&mdash;," said the Sky
Pilot. "I should be present during the disturbances
and some one might get hurt. Is
your hospital ticket good?"</p>

<p>While the minister looked at the cursing
foreman he felt a strong desire to enforce a
lesson in common courtesy,&mdash;that part of the
foreman's education having evidently been
neglected. But he thought, if I should do
this physical duty the lumberjacks who are
my friends will refuse to work for the foreman
and the proprietor's kindness will be repaid
with loss. He therefore decided to forego
the privilege of improving the foreman's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
manner's, and for the proprietor's sake to say
nothing that would come to the ears of the
lumberjacks.</p>

<p>When the missionaries left the camp Mr.
G&mdash; was not through with the incident, for
the foreman's remarks had been overheard
by some of the men and were soon the common
property of the camp. The next day
the foreman went into the blacksmith shop,
and not being over civil to the vulcan in
charge, was suddenly seized, dragged over
the anvil and kicked out into the snow by
the wrathy smith. As G&mdash; was gathering
himself up, the man of metals gave him an
extra kick and accompanied it with this enlightening
remark:</p>

<p>"There, blast your Hades seared hide, is
an extra one for the glad hand you gave the
Sky Pilot yesterday. You son of the nameless,
I'll teach you how to treat your betters
and make your blank soul respect the
clergy."</p>

<p>As a result of the incident a number of
the men quit the camp, refusing to work for
a "push who ain't got no decency."</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Men who serve the Master will at the same
time serve men. It seems but proper to demand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
of the Christian that he prove his profession
by his love of humanity. The religion
that is only preached meets few demands,
the religion that is lived satisfies
human wants. Jesus Christ bore a relation of
helpfulness to the burdened world; the disciples
of the Nazarene cannot do less than
follow the example of the man loving Master.
At least, this is the expectancy of the
men, they simply take the Christian at his
word. Mr. Higgins has instanced this many
times, for his parishioners feel that when a
man is needed the Christian should be the
first to respond.</p>

<p>"Pilot," said a lumberjack to Mr. Higgins,
"I've got a friend in the saloon over yonder
and the drunken fool is blowing his stake
as fast as he can throw it over the bar. I
ain't able to get him out and the bar tender
would give me a hunch to get out myself
if I tried. Will you help me?"</p>

<p>"Come on," said the preacher. "We'll see
what we can do together."</p>

<p>As they entered the barroom the woodsman
pointed out his friend. Paddy was in
that hilarious state of intoxication where liberality
knows no bounds. He staggered up
to the bar and in drunken happiness cried:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
"Here, bung swater, set up to the house.
Hades while the dough lasts. Turn the spigot
and give us a beer bath."</p>

<p>Paddy generously emptied his pockets on
the metal counter and a roll of bills and a
handful of silver lay before the crowd.</p>

<p>The bar tender reached for the cash to
sweep it into the till, but he was not quick
enough, for the large hand of the missionary
covered the roll of bills.</p>

<p>"I'll take this for my treat, Paddy," said
Mr. Higgins in a quiet but decisive tone.</p>

<p>"No you don't," said the saloon man and
he hastened to attack the intruder.</p>

<p>"Stand back," said the preacher. "You're
not in my class, and I can't reduce my heft
to accommodate a middle weight at this late
hour."</p>

<p>The bar tender was full of fight and menacingly
waved a weapon at the preacher, and
several seconded him in the contest.</p>

<p>"Sit down, you heated fools," cried a
campman; "that's the Sky Pilot, and the
man that tackles him tackles me and some
others."</p>

<p>"Paddy has had more than enough liquor
already," continued the preacher, "the silver
I left on the bar is more than sufficient to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
treat the crowd at his expense, so I'll keep
the rest as Paddy's banker until he is in a
condition to know the value of it." Turning
to the saloonman, he said, "You call yourself
a man and yet you would take all the winter's
earnings of a poor fellow who is not in
his right mind. You are a scoundrel or you
would have sent this fellow away long ago."</p>

<p>Mr. Higgins and his friend got Paddy on
the train and carried him to Bemidji where
they put him to bed.</p>

<p>Next morning Paddy wandered into the
lobby where the preacher was sitting. "Some
one robbed me last night," he began; "they
took every cent I had and pinched my hat
and coat. What am I goin' to do?"</p>

<p>"Go home. That's what you're going to
do," said the preacher with decision. "Nobody
robbed you Paddy, nobody needed to.
When I met you last night you were throwing
your money away faster than they could
take it from you. You had already lost your
coat and you threw your hat out of the car
window on the way here. But we managed
to save a little for you, enough to get you
back home." The preacher handed him the
roll of bills he had saved. It contained
forty dollars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
Paddy took the advice of the Sky Pilot
and left at once for home, never again to
appear among his old associates in the pineries.
He is the brother of a respected
Catholic priest, and comes of a prominent
family.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The proverb reads, "A man is known by
the company he keeps." In the main the
proverb is true, but it is not always applicable.
A slum worker differs from his associates;
a camp worker is with the worst element
of the camps more than with the men
who walk straight; he goes where he is
needed, and, like the Master, he is a friend
of publicans and sinners. But he who lifts
another does not lower himself, even if he
has to stoop in order to lift. In fact, I doubt
if there be even the suggestion of stooping.
Although the physical figure implies the act&mdash;I
rather believe that the good man lifts
himself when he extends his hand down to
another. Let me tell you a story, one that is
well known in the northern woods:</p>

<p>A&mdash;&mdash; was built for doing things, and
looked the part. If you were judging from
appearances you would say that he was one
of the best, and if you asked for confirmation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
of your opinion the lumberjack would answer
regarding him, "None better in all the
north woods,"&mdash;a high physical certification.</p>

<p>For some time A&mdash;&mdash; had been a foreman.
His abilities won the admiration of the men
and his habits of life made him feared,&mdash;it
was another case of what whiskey can do
with a man.</p>

<p>Once when Mr. Higgins was preaching in
A&mdash;&mdash;'s camp, A&mdash;&mdash; came into the meeting and
drunkenly listened to the minister as he
pleaded with the men to forsake evil and get
right with God. A tense stillness hung over
the bunkhouse and all the audience listened
in sympathy.</p>

<p>Suddenly another voice broke into the
harmony. It was A&mdash;&mdash; crying in fervid encouragement:
"Lace it to them, Higgins,
give them hell, old boy, the drunken sons of
the nameless need a dose of religion to make
them log right."</p>

<p>"Don't notice him, boys," said Mr. Higgins;
"that is whiskey that is talking. A&mdash;&mdash; would
be ashamed of that sort of thing if he
were sober, but whiskey isn't ashamed of
anything."</p>

<p>At the end of Frank Higgins' first year
in Bemidji, when the camps were pouring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
their men into the towns, he happened to
visit the little town of Farley, Minnesota.
The lumberjacks owned the town. The long
drought of winter was turned into a deluge
and it was the evident intention of the foresters
to consume in a day enough to make up
for the enforced abstinence. A stream of
coin passed over the bar and a tide of liquor
came from the other side.</p>

<p>Near a saloon a laughing crowd watched
the antics of a powerful fellow who drunkenly
wallowed in the mud. Bewilderingly
fluent and ingeniously profane was the man
in the gutter, and his drunken comrades
raised their laughter of approval at his antics
and remarks. Pushing his way through the
crowd, Mr. Higgins came upon the object of
their mirth&mdash;it was A&mdash;&mdash;, the foreman, too
drunk to care about or to understand his
degradation.</p>

<p>The missionary helped the foolish fellow
to his feet and, leaning him against a building
for support, scraped the filth from his
garments with a shovel.</p>

<p>The father and brother-in-law of A&mdash;&mdash; were
in the village and to them the missionary,
took his drunken charge. A&mdash;&mdash; had been
working but a few miles from home but had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
not visited his people for two years. When
the relatives saw their son and brother, at the
same time realizing his helplessness in the
presence of temptation, they asked the missionary
to take him to the Keeley Cure at
Minneapolis, two hundred miles away.</p>

<p>Mr. Higgins was not anxious for the task,
but he knew that there was a chance for at
least a partial reformation, and anything
was an improvement on the present way of
living. The only way to accomplish the
journey with an unwilling patient was to
keep the man drunk and get him to the institute
while under the influence of his
enemy&mdash;this was beating the devil with his
first lieutenant. So the minister packed his
grip with unministerial baggage&mdash;whiskey&mdash;and
patiently waited his train. It took
three men to get the logger into the car, and
with the beginning of the journey the real
troubles of the temperance worker began.
On one side was the grip loaded with bottles,
on the other a man loaded with whiskey. The
only thing that suggested the ministry was
the half fare permit, and that was out of
sight.</p>

<p>No wonder the conductor smiled when the
minister presented his credentials. As the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
railroader punched the ticket, he said: "Are
you on your way to Presbytery with a lay
delegate, or are you both bound for a distillery
convention?"</p>

<p>The smoking car was crowded with woodsmen
on their way to the city. A&mdash;&mdash; was in
fighting trim and only the ever present bottle
could keep him from stirring up the
crowd. Every few minutes the minister
passed him the bottle and it acted like paregoric
on a colicky baby. "It was the only
time I tended bar all day, and I am not anxious
to repeat the experience," said Mr.
Higgins.</p>

<p>At Spur 25, A&mdash;&mdash; was sufficiently sober to
recognize a friend who was waiting on the
platform, and immediately he cried to the
ministerial bar tender, "Here, Sky Pilot,
give Kirk a drink. Hand him the glass
works and let him sample the cold tea."</p>

<p>Between Farley and Walker the effluvia
from bodies long immune to water, the disregard
of sanitary requirements, the expectorations
and the foul air of the crowded car
became unbearable. The missionary felt it
very necessary that he should go elsewhere
and breathe a cleaner atmosphere, so he
called a teamster and installed him as bartender<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
while he went into the day coach to
breathe. A&mdash;&mdash;'s father was in the day coach
but did not dare to approach his drunken
son.</p>

<p>The missionary had not counted all the
possible exigencies when he pressed the
teamster into service. The substitute bartender
had solaced himself with the liquid
goods before entering the train, and was soon
in a rapturous state from the mixture
brought about from imbibing A&mdash;&mdash;'s whiskey.
Every time A&mdash;&mdash; demanded a drink the
driver took one himself, and being a frugal
soul, drank largely because another was paying
the bill. He was a happy jack and expressed
himself in song. It was the eighteenth
of March, the day after St. Patrick's
Day. On the platform at Walker a crowd of
Irishmen were lounging, the green ribbons
of yesterday's celebration adorning their
lapels. The maudlin teamster was a protestant
Irishman, and the green streamers
aroused in his befuddled mind visions of
glorious Londonderry days where the fist
played a larger part in religion than it does
in Minnesota. Leaning far out the window,
until he seemed to balance on his belt buckle,
he began the soul stirring melody "Protestant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
Boys." At least it was soul stirring to the
Catholic Irish. At the depot the old scenes
of Londonderry were renewed and a blow
drove the teamster across the car and jammed
him between the seats on the filthy
floor. The feet of the Orangeman stuck high
in the air, and though the trainmen tried
to release him, they could not.</p>

<p>Unaware of what was happening in the
next car, the minister was talking with A&mdash;&mdash;'s
father when the conductor broke into the
conversation.</p>

<p>"Come into the smoker and take care of
your parishioners, Mr. Higgins," he said
hurriedly, "we can't handle that booze-soaked
crew."</p>

<p>When Mr. Higgins entered the car he
found that he had two patients that needed
his immediate attention.</p>

<p>At Brainerd they changed cars and waited
two hours for the Minneapolis train. The
minister took his charge into the station.
Here A&mdash;&mdash; gave an exhibition of drunken
hilarity that drove out the self-respecting
loungers and caused the station master to
demand A&mdash;&mdash;'s exit. The streets received the
minister and his charge, but after a few improper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
acts and worse remarks an officer
ordered them off the streets.</p>

<p>The only places open to the strollers were
the saloons, and the minister led his companion
into one of them. The saloonmen,
because of the natural results of their business
can stand considerable of the unusual,
but this woodsman was able to give the denizens
of Billingsgate advance instruction in
the unprintable and nauseating. Not having
lost all sense of the fitness of things, the saloon
keeper escorted the woodsman to the
door and Mr. Higgins again linked himself
to the staggering man.</p>

<p>From one side of the walk to the other
the powerful logger dragged the husky
preacher, and as they continued through the
streets the blasphemy and filth flowed on.
It was the expected that happened; a representative
of law and order threatened to lock
up both pedestrians in the city jail&mdash;for the
logger dragged the minister in his zig-zag
course and both appeared drunken. But in
spite of the rough clothes, the policeman
soon recognized the Sky Pilot and placed the
city jail at his disposal while waiting for the
south bound train.</p>

<p>When A&mdash;&mdash; realized he was in the police<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
station his temper suddenly arose and he
rushed with closed fist at his companion.
Mr. Higgins anticipated the attack and
deftly stepped aside. The heavy blow fell
on the panel of the station door, and a split
panel and bruised knuckles were the results.</p>

<p>After some hours Minneapolis was
reached, a cab took them to the Institute and
the worst was over.</p>

<p>The minister and the patient entered the
big rest room of the Institute just as the bell
signaled the patients to prepare for treatment.
The inmates began to remove their
coats and to roll up their shirt sleeves so that
the treatment could be injected into their
arms. The removing of coats pleased A&mdash;&mdash;,
for it savored of a fight and he began to prepare
for a conflict. Hastily he removed his
coat and with raised guard and closed fist
staggeringly advanced towards the coatless
men who had fallen into line to march past
the doctor. Instead of the anticipated fight,
A&mdash;&mdash; received his first treatment,&mdash;the course
in the Keeley Cure had begun.</p>

<p>Several years have passed since the above
incident, but A&mdash;&mdash; is still a sober man. Respected
for his ability, honored by those who
employ him, he stands high in the confidence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
of one of the largest lumber companies,
and large interests are in his hands.
While not a professing Christian, yet he is
a strong advocate of temperance, for, having
known the degradation of drink, he now appreciates
the virtue of sobriety.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Quebec, with its French population, raises
many loyal Catholic sons. The training of
the province does not develop a bias towards
Protestantism. Anything savoring of it is
distasteful to them, due to centuries of training.
When these sons migrate to the woods
of Minnesota the inherited and trained prejudice
is likely to accompany them. On the
above paragraph a story hinges.</p>

<p>In the north woods of Tenstrike worked
a French Canadian, whom, for obvious reasons
as well as convenience, we will call "Old
Quebec." Now, "Old Quebec" was neither
a scholar nor a fool. He knew a few things,
and the many things of which he knew
nothing did not disturb his mental bias or
unsettle his decision. He was a man of likes
and dislikes and he gave his whole strength
to either; he never asked himself whether
his likes or dislikes were reasonable, he was
simply satisfied to be out-and-out in opposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
or comradeship. What he hated he
cursed; what he respected he was always on
hand to assist. Well, he cursed the Sky Pilot
whenever he saw him.</p>

<p>"Old Quebec" had no love for religion of
any kind, but if a man wished to profess any
spiritual relationship, Quebec was so trained
that only Catholicism was acceptable to him.
Therefore, when the Rev. Frank E. Higgins
came to the camp in which Old Quebec
worked the Frenchman thought him a non-entity
because he was religious and a fool because
he was not a Catholic. If you had
asked Old Quebec, "Aren't you prejudiced?"
he would have laughed, probably have sworn
you out of countenance, and in his blasphemous
way have given you the information,
"What I know I know." His answer
would have satisfied him and his profanity
have settled you.</p>

<p>So, at the meeting, on the missionary's first
appearance, Old Quebec did all he could to
disturb and interfere. When asked to give
the others the privilege of hearing, he replied
with a torrent of invective, blasphemy
and vulgarity that shocked the ears of every
decent man in the camp. Now there are
some men whom one can not easily eject.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
Old Quebec was probably one of these, at
least, the missionary decided that discretion
was the better part of valor. For once there
were two speakers at the meeting, and Mr.
Higgins, being more accustomed to public
speaking, won out.</p>

<p>Few men could equal Old Quebec with
the peavy. When there were logs to sack in
the shallows of the river he was the man to
keep the stuff from jamming, or when they
jammed, to find the key log and break the
obstruction. He was strong as hammered
steel and bore himself as the king of the
crew. He satisfied himself by cursing the
missionary on all occasions, and the missionary
was satisfied to talk him to a stand still.
True, the missionary had tried to win the
man, but Old Quebec was unapproachable.</p>

<p>One Sunday night the missionary went
to a hotel in Tenstrike and after spending
some time in conversation with the loungers,
he started for the barn to see if his dog team
was comfortable for the night. On the way
to the barn he passed the ice house, before
which lay several cakes of ice. As he passed
between the cakes the missionary stumbled
over the body of a man. The body was motionless
and cold, and although he felt for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
evidence of life he could discover none.
Rushing into the hotel saloon, the preacher
called for assistance. Old Quebec was at the
bar drinking.</p>

<p>"Come on, Quebec," cried Mr. Higgins,
"get the lantern and help me with a dead
or dying man."</p>

<p>Procuring a lantern, the missionary and
the Frenchman hurried into the yard.</p>

<p>"Take hold of his feet, Quebec," said the
preacher as he put his arms around the
cold body, but Old Quebec, true to his superstition,
refused to touch what was apparently
a dead body.</p>

<p>The missionary got the body on his back,
Quebec held the lantern, and the body was
carried into the saloon. Fortunately the
man was not dead, but was drunk and
frozen, and, had it not been for the timely
aid would soon have succumbed. In the
saloon the missionary worked over the helpless
man until consciousness returned.</p>

<p>"Take care of him," said the minister to
the hotel man, "for I must leave early.
Charge the expense to me."</p>

<p>Old Quebec heard the remark.</p>

<p>In the course of a few days the Sky Pilot
visited the camp in which Old Quebec worked.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
The service began, but no word from
the old man, although he sat in a prominent
place.</p>

<p>"I suppose Quebec's waiting till the
preaching commences," whispered one of the
boys to a neighbor.</p>

<p>The preaching began. Through it all
Quebec listened with attention, no sign of interruption
came from him.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with Old Quebec?"
the minister asked himself, "is the fellow
sick, there's so little action in him?"</p>

<p>After the meeting was over the Frenchman
beckoned to the preacher. Wonderingly,
Mr. Higgins approached him.</p>

<p>"There it is, Pilot," said the Frenchman,
extending his hand, "that's yours now.
Will you shake it? I've been pretty rough on
you. I ain't got much time for religion, but
after what I saw that Sunday night in Tenstrike,
I'm settled. You're willing to do for
us poor fools what we ain't got sense enough
to do for ourselves. Anything I can do for
you, Pilot, I do. What I know I know.
I'm with you."</p>

<p>As strong in his friendship as he was in
his hatred is Old Quebec, ever ready to
give a helping hand to the missionary, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
as a contrast to the past he now feels that he
is responsible for the decorum of the camp.
Woe be it to the jack who dares to interfere
with one of Mr. Higgins' meetings if Old
Quebec is present. Once in Bemidji a crowd
of lumberjacks was standing on the sidewalk
when Old Quebec, who was in the
group, saw Mr. Higgins approaching.</p>

<p>"Open up the road for the Pilot," cried
Old Quebec, "he's made the sledding easy for
many a one of us, so I'll road monkey for
him."</p>

<p>(The road monkey is the man who keeps
the ice roads clean.)</p>

<p>The old fellow listens now, and others listen
at his bidding,&mdash;Faith cometh by hearing,
so Old Quebec's chances are bettered, for
the word is like leaven.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>It is not preaching alone that is needed in
the solitudes of the forest; even here pastoral
work has its place, often a large place.
Had the apostle Paul been visiting the lumber
camps of Asia Minor when he wished
to be all things to all men, or had he just
beheld the ancient lumberjacks as they
poured into the Athenian bowery after a
winter's chopping on the slopes of God forsaken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
Olympia? Whatever the cause of the
thought, it expresses the need of the missionary
who would work in the camps. But
Paul was himself a missionary, and that explains
why he knew the qualities of heart
and hand essential to successful work.</p>

<p>Frank Higgins is a pastor, preacher, friend
and brother to his heterogeneous flock.
Their concerns are his interests and they
know that if they need assistance this minister
will extend it gladly. The following
incident will illustrate this point:</p>

<p>A.&nbsp;M. was a man who had followed the
camps for years. In his years of logging he
had acquired a little property, was happily
married, and several children came to
lighten his home. His wages were above his
expenditures and he was making financial
progress. But if you wish to introduce a
change in the even march of progress, introduce
drink. This is what A. did.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img id="if_illo_243" src="images/illo_243.jpg" width="600" height="346" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption">A HOMESTEADER'S SHACK</div></div>

<p>It was then the old, old story of retrogression
through alcohol. The property he
prized as the fruit of industry gradually
passed into other hands and a darker side
of life was seen, in which the woodsman, his
wife and children were all involved. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
saloons handled his wages and a respected
man sank into the maw of appetite.</p>

<p>In one of the saloons the Rev. F.&nbsp;E. Higgins
found the rum-soaked Scotchman on
the verge of delirium tremens. The missionary
took the helpless man to his home in the
forest and began to nurse him back to health
and sobriety. Two days and nights he sat
beside the bed until the drunken visions
passed and reason began to return.</p>

<p>While the missionary was attending his
self-assumed patient he gathered every piece
of the man's clothing into a bundle and sent
them over to the home of a neighbor. Not
a single garment belonging to the man was
left in the house. It was a course of heroic
treatment that was in store for the patient.</p>

<p>When M. began to regain his reason he
was besides himself for liquor, but there was
none to be had. Leaping from the bed he
sought in all parts of the house for his clothing
so he could return to the saloons and
quench the consuming thirst, but no successful
find rewarded his diligence. He begged
for his clothing, but the man who sat beside
his bed was deaf to entreaty. It was a seige
in which the besieged could not even claim
the primitive fig leaf. If the watcher had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
not restrained him he would have rushed
out of the house, but the man who had sent
his clothes away never relaxed his vigilance
The house was a prison.</p>

<p>The hours passed and the man became
milder. The Sky Pilot drew out memories of
better days; the long-closed chambers of
memory slowly opened, and with the return
came the recollections of the days when freedom
crowned the life and evil habits were as
yet unborn. Such remembrances create the
desire to reproduce again the life of freedom.
While M. was sighing for the past joys, Mr.
Higgins was pointing him to the One who
said, "I came that ye might have life, and
have it more abundantly." At last in the
shadow of the sin absorbing Cross the brawny
preacher and weakened slave knelt side by
side. To him who proclaimed liberty to the
captive and to them that are bound they
prayed, and when they arose two freemen
clasped hands in friendship and Christian
fellowship.</p>

<p>M. realized that while he was free, yet
sin had weakened him, so he gathered his belongings
together and with his family left
the place of his temptation and fall and
emigrated to Manitoba. While I write, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
letter is on my desk. It is from M.'s wife
telling of his later life. She who wrote the
letter was a Catholic, but she tells of the God-given
strength that came to M., how during
the years since his conversion he had lived
under the sustaining grace of Christ. "Both
my husband and son united with the Presbyterian
Church here, and when at last they
brought the father from a northern camp,
bruised and dying, his faith held fast to the
Savior who took him from the pit."</p>

<span class="subhead">THE FIELD AND ITS POSSIBILITIES.</span></h2>

<p>The Evangelistic Committee of the Presbyterian
Church has been active in the logging
camp work since 1902, when it first sent
missionaries to preach in the camps of Minnesota
and Wisconsin.</p>

<p>The first missionaries it appointed to this
work were Rev. Jos. Oliver Buswell and Rev.
F.&nbsp;E. Higgins, the former taking the work
in Wisconsin and the latter in Minnesota.
Both these men had been carrying on private
work in the camps near their pastorates.
Prior to 1907 the work was largely experimental
and on a small scale, but in the summer
of the above-named year a strong sub-committee
of the Evangelistic committee
took charge of the logging camp mission
work and an aggressive campaign was inaugurated.</p>

<p>In the foregoing pages of this little
volume we have considered the work in Minnesota<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
exclusively and presented only the
part which came directly under the hand of
Mr. Higgins: now we desire to give a brief
view of a more extended field.</p>

<p>The sub-committee known as the Lumberman's
Evangelistic Council is composed of
men who are individually interested in this
work. They are prominent lumbermen or
well-known ministers, as the personnel of the
committee shows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mr. W. A. Holt, Oconto, Wis.</li>
<li>Mr. Arthur D. Wheeler, Chicago, Ill.</li>
<li>Mr. C. A. Barton, Minneapolis, Minn.</li>
<li>Mr. E. T. Buxton, Duluth, Minn.</li>
<li>Dr. J. M. Gray, Chicago, Ill.</li>
<li>Dr. W. O. Carrier, Waukesha, Wis.</li>
<li>Mr. Dewitt Van Ostrand, Philips, Wis.</li>
<li>Dr. J. Beveridge Lee, Chicago, Ill.</li>
<li>Dr. W. J. Darby, Evansville, Ind.</li>
</ul>

<p>The officers of the council are:</p>

<ul><li>Hon. Hugh H. Hanna, Chairman, Indianapolis, Ind.</li>
<li>Mr. J. E. Defebaugh, Vice Chairman, Chicago, Ill.</li>
<li>Dr. P. E. Zartman, Secretary and Treasurer, Winona Lake, Ind.</li>
<li><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>Rev. F. E. Higgins, Superintendent of Camp Work, Rockford, Minn.</li>
<li>Rev. J. O. Buswell, General Superintendent, Lumber Exchange, Minneapolis, Minn.</li>
</ul>

<p>The desire of the Lumberman's Evangelistic
Council is to place the services of the
missionaries at the disposal of all the lumber
camps in the west, so that the general morals
of the workers may be raised and a corresponding
plain of righteousness and ability
be reached.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img id="if_illo_253" src="images/illo_253.jpg" width="600" height="346" alt="" /><br /><div class="caption">THE STEAM HAULER</div></div>

<p>The superintendents of this work are well
equipped for the task before them. Mr.
Buswell has been an interested worker in the
camps for some years. He felt that God
called him to this particular work, and has
been instrumental in leading many of the
foresters to Christ.</p>

<p>The reader of these pages knows that Mr.
Higgins brings to the work the practical experience
of twelve years, and a devotion to
God and man that brings results.</p>

<p>Through Mr. Buswell and Mr. Higgins
the claims of the lumberjacks have been
presented to the churches and by their efforts
almost all the money used to carry on
the work in the past, except their own
salaries, has been raised. Under their direction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
a number of helpers have been at work
in the field, the superintendents being individually
responsible for their salaries and
expenses.</p>

<p>Beyond the States of Minnesota and Wisconsin,
a little work was also done in Michigan
and Washington. In the State of Washington
Mr. Higgins spent the last two summers,
taking with him, in 1907, two of his
best camp chaplains.</p>

<p>The future is ruddy with promise. With
the more extensive organization come hopes
of greater efficiency and broader possibilities.
The desires of a few men have become the
wishes and prayers of a greater number. The
sub-committee's intention is to reach all the
western and southwestern States in which
the men of ax and peavey are at work.</p>

<p>As yet only the edges of the field have
been approached; even in Minnesota where
the work is more extended, only one hundred
camps are touched, while four hundred
other camps are left entirely to themselves.
Many of the States are without any organized
work in the lumber regions.</p>

<p>A view of the States west and south will
reveal larger timber districts where this mission<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
work will find a welcome and where
aggressive extension is immediately imperative.</p>

<p>Western Montana has its camps on the
tree-covered mountain slopes. Idaho computes
its timbered acres at ten millions. Timber
is one of the principal resources of the
State of Washington. The western slopes of
the Cascades are heavily wooded with fir and
on the eastern side blue and yellow pine predominate.
Oregon is proud of its pine forests,
the density of the woods is inviting to
industry and solitude. The Douglas spruce
has made this State a world-famous mart for
masts and spars. California is the home of
the redwood, and all the world reads of its
mammoths of the forest; but in the northern
part of the State pine, oak and fir lure the
lumber companies, and there the lumberjacks
are calling for services.</p>

<p>Southwest of Minnesota the numerous
camps of the timbered Black Hills catch the
eye, then come the sixteen million mountain
acres of forest land in the neighboring State
of Wyoming, and an almost equal stretch
in Colorado. Missouri is also well wooded,
in all except the northern and western<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
parts, and the State of Arkansas has twenty-five
million acres of timber wealth. Louisiana
has more than half of the timber
acreage of Arkansas. The State of Texas
does not count its wooded lands by acres; it
presents the figures of sixty-four thousand
square miles.</p>

<p>The possibilities of this evangelistic work
are noticeable in the above sketch of the
western and southern forests. Where the
lumber is to be obtained, there are the lumber
camps and the lumberjacks. The surroundings
of the men are much the same as in
Minnesota, with the restraints of civilization
removed and the agents of viciousness always
at hand. The foresters present a picture at
which the angels weep and the devils are joyful.</p>

<p>Lumbering has been a prominent industry
for many years in Michigan, Wisconsin and
Minnesota, and it will continue to play a
large part in the industry of these States for
twenty years to come. In such States the
camps are large, grouped and accessible
therefore the mission work can be done with
greater ease and economy than in the older
States of the east where the lumbercamps are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
far apart and small. In the west a camp
chaplain can serve as high as fifteen camps,
giving them each a service at least twice a
month.</p>

<p>Seventy-five dollars a month will support a
chaplain. Since the logging season is short,
in Minnesota about five and a half months, it
will be seen that a large amount of good can
be accomplished at a small expenditure. A
chaplain will preach to from sixty to one
hundred and sixty men every night in the
week and on Sunday perhaps preach in three
different camps. He is the representative of
spiritual truths to from six hundred to one
thousand men. Where, at so little cost, are
the possibilities of good so great? Where are
these camp preachers to be obtained? "I believe
that God will call to this work the men
of the pineries rather than the men of the
seminaries," said the Rev. F.&nbsp;E. Higgins.
This has been so in the past. The men who
are converted in the camps are equipped
with a knowledge of conditions through experience,
and where mental and spiritual
ability are present they can do excellent
work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
Several of the successful workers in the
camp mission were once lumberjacks. Mr.
Fred Davis, who, since the promotion of Mr.
Higgins, is superintendent of the Minnesota
work, was at one time a lumberjack. Mr.
Davis refused an excellent business position
in order to spend his life reaching the foresters.</p>

<p>Another worker is Mr. L.&nbsp;C. Michells, a
former cruiser and estimator. Mr. Michells
is not only a strong preacher, but is physically
able to care for himself when opposition is
presented,&mdash;to this the ex-mayor of a lumber
town can testify to his sorrow, as can
others who saw the fallen political boss
hauled home on a dray after the encounter
with right and might. At the time of writing,
Mr. Michells is preaching in the camps
of Washington.</p>

<p>God is raising up men. Will the Christian
church raise the means?</p>

<p>Through the work done in Minnesota and
Wisconsin an introduction has been secured
to all the Western States; the timber lands
of the west are owned largely by the firms
who have exploited the woods adjacent to the
Great Lakes, and these companies know the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
good accomplished here, hence a ready welcome
is given to the missionary going to
more western fields. The lumberjacks are
naturally wanderers and in the camps of the
Pacific slopes the Minnesota and Wisconsin
woodsmen are already there to give the chaplains
welcome. Mr. Higgins tells of preaching
in a town on the Tacoma Eastern Railway
in Washington:</p>

<p>"In one town where no religious organization
was at work, I held services in a dance
hall, and seventy-five persons were present,
sixty of whom were loggers. After the service
two lumberjacks came up to me and said:
'Hello, Pilot, don't you know us? We're a
couple of your Minnesota boys. Don't you
remember preaching in the Clearwater
Camps on 'The Chances a Fellow Has if
He'll Take Them?' Well, we broke away
from the gang, came out here, have saved
our money, and are the ones who rustled the
crowd for you tonight.'</p>

<p>"On another occasion I was to speak in
the open air, when an old Minnesota campman
brought a pitcher of lemonade and
placed it by my side. After the meeting he
invited me to his home and wanted me to
make it mine while I labored in that place.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
Such kindness from the men who had been
my boys in the North Star pineries did much
to make my work in Washington a
pleasure."</p>

<p>By the past work the doors of the present
have been forced open. The waiting men
are inviting the bearers of good tidings to
enter&mdash;shall we refuse? Where there is a
need shall not the Christian Church supply
it?</p>

<p>Douglas Malloch, the lumbermen's poet,
presents us a picture of the field in the following
